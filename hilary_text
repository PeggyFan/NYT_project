0,This is pure Woodward self-promotion.
1,"Barring complete catastrophe, there's no way Hillary will challenge Obama in 2012.  That would split the party and ensure defeat.  Her only shot is 2016."
2,Now here's a story that only a Beltway bon vivant would care about.
3,"The fact that people are talking about this, and the administration is taking their valuable time to dismiss a speculative story suggests unrest, and the possibility that things might not be well in the executive realm.  Of course, who nows for sure?  ""Game Change"" was a good book, though."
4,"No, no wrong moves.  Leave Biden where he is. it's where his unguarded tongue will do the least damage! Imagine him as Secretary of State being diplomatic!!<br />Switch Hilary and Obama. He can make nice with world leaders and she can lead. it's the way it should have been from the start."
5,"Why would anyone want as Secretary of State a man who is loathed by the leadership of Iraq and Afghanistan and is generally regarded as an idiot?  I know that Obama has turned out to be a lot less bright than he was portrayed prior to his election, but even he can't be this stupid.<br />Anyway, Hillary will resign by next summer so that she can primary Obama in 2012."
6,"Never underestimate the Obmas or the Clintons or the voters! The fact is there are simply no viable republican candidates for 2012 or 2016 and Americans will not support the current crop of wing-nuts, I don't care how hard the media lunatics try to make it so."
7,"I'm already wearing my ""Hillary In 12"" button. Goodness gracious. she'll be our next Prezzie! not Vice Prezzie. And: Jill Biden, you tacky twit - why don't you tell the world once again, how obama offered your dopey husband his choice between VP &amp; Sec of State just as Hillary was about to be sworn in. Good riddance to the Blabbermout Bidens! And none to soon if you ask me!"
8,"lets concentrate on the real issue,obama must go!"
9,Technically competent men usually have very little difficulty obtaining the deference of women on technical issues. 
10,Talk about putting lipstick on the pig. Why not also rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic? The man needs to become a leader and not just an instrument to bring about social changes.
11,"Hmmm....  This sounds very much like a trial balloon to check the flack.  I suppose if true, it would be the ticket of 2008, had not the Clinton's kind of savaged Obama during the primaries.  All you tea party good ole boys better get ready for the Anti Palin; somebody smart and competent who knows how to throw punches and doesn't mind doing it."
12,"Had Hillary won, Bill's Economic team would have turned the Economy around by now. Obama is a HUGE dissappointment and the ""Hope"" is gone."
13,"In today`s age of  high tech weaponry President Hillary will nuke those that gave her a migraine, she is known to fly into a rage if annoyed. It is a scientific fact that female tolerance levels are much lower than that of a male, my personal observations leads me to believe that ladies are more “picky and choosy” than men, it is a natural design to make sure that the Alpha Male is selected over inferior types.  President Hillary would not tolerate a guy like Ahamadijan for more than a moment, Cruise Missiles would quickly send him to paradise. Traditional scientific evidence of my opinions will not be forthcoming."
14,"It doesn't matter who's in the white house or who changes jobs.  When is the voting public going to learn that there is no one person that can wave a magic wand for change?  It isn't a president that makes things better.  It's an informed electorate.  The people sit around on their hands whining about why things are the way they are while they let the corporate thieves pay themselves millions and starve the rest of us out.  We don't NEED all the crap these corporations sell...stop buying it, vote out incumbants...do something yourselves at the ballot box that will benefit the majority instead of your own narrow selfish wants.  It's not about Obama...he's one man, a novice and, a black one at that, in a racist society...what the heck did you expect...?"
15,This idea has been floated since President Obama's administration began to take shape.  Why is it being treated like serious news?
16,Hillary herself is not working out. What has she really done these past couple of 2 years. Nothing really. #18<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Hillary is working out great.  She has the respect of world leaders and has helped restore the dignity lost by Bush to our relationships with other countries.  What has she done?  The role of SOS is behind the scenes.  It's not a high profile position; Kissinger excluded; so when you say she's hasn't done anything what you really men is you don't understand the nature of her job.
17,"From a practical standpoint very few Secretaries of State stay for a second term Presindent as regardless of perfomance it requires long hours and full time travel. The VP is the diametrical opposite - a perpetual holding pattern requiring no actual work just an insurance policy.<br /><br />I preferred Clinton for VP in 2008 but the Bush/Clinton overload was in play. By taking the Sec of State after tough and sometimes contentious primary contrasted with McCaiin's who's faustian deal with Hukabee sabatoged any chance of a Rommney, Thompson, Guilliani, on the ticket or in the cabinet.<br /><br />I think what makes this exciting gossip is some lofty idea they would govern like the 2 consuls of the Roman Republic. This would be truly unconstitional. In fact Cheney should have been impeached but like so many of Bush's distortions of the true conservatism the War on Terror provided the cover. He was a disaster."
18,Why preach this stuff?   Doesn’t the decision already made by thousands of American citizens stand for anything?<br />
19,"The question of whether Hillary Clinton will be the vice president or at the State department is secondary to issues like unemployment and American economic competitiveness, but celebrity always wins out in news coverage."
20,"I like Hillary, and, as a professor, I especially like the way her success encourages and empowers young women, who deserve role models in every office, including the oval one.<br /><br />That said, as a person on the left, I prefer the more risk-taking 21st century Democrats to those of the 1990s, just as I prefer health care reform that passes to reform that failed, financial regulation to deregulation, and governing with majorities to fighting as a minority party.  Only if Hillary meaningfully separates herself from her spouse's fealty to corporate interests (far closer ties, it seems to me, than Obama's), would I welcome an expanded role for her.<br /><br />And since no one seems to stand by the rumor, Woodward's reliability comes into question.<br /><br />Could this just be wishful thinking from someone who misses the 1990s? "
21," When books don't sell like they should, you just make things up I guess??<br />"
22,Oh wait!  Biden cannot be secretary of state because an intelligent person with social skills needs to be in that post.<br />Biden is either senile or an idiot..........or both.<br />I cannot imagine him meeting with heads of state and not offending every one of them.
23,Commentor 33 - I agree with. Politicians basically are NOT accountable to or don't really answer to the people who vote them into office. They answer [across the board] to the ever powerful corporate elite. So what is the average voter to do? Protest YES - but to the corporations. It can be done. What else is there?<br />ALSO - average voters - need to be more informed about the issues - information is but a click away....

289,"First of all, this idea was first proposed publically by Governor Wilder, the first black governor of Virginia.  He discussed it on the Chris Matthews show about 6 months ago.  He said that Joe Biden wanted to be secretary of state to begin with.  That Obama may need some help with working-class voters, who Bill and Hillary have a good relationship with, and that Hillary would probably like to run for President in 2016, which is easier done from the VP slot than sec of state.  And finally, that secretary of state is a job that people do not ordinarily do for more than four years.  All told, that sounds like Biden and Clinton and Obama may all benefit from this.<br /><br />And lastly, Barack Obama has the best legislative record of any president, Democrat or Republican, since FDR.

290,Yes!  Put Hiliary one heart beat away from the presidency.  I voted for her and wanted her in the White House.  Well I wanted Bill back in the White House.

575,Commentor 33 - I agree with. Politicians basically are NOT accountable to or don't really answer to the people who vote them into office. They answer [across the board] to the ever powerful corporate elite. So what is the average voter to do? Protest YES - but to the corporations. It can be done. What else is there?<br />ALSO - average voters - need to be more informed about the issues - information is but a click away....

Well they can cut taxes. But in this poor economy any tax savings will be saved or used to pay down debt not used to buy new products and services. What is left? More government spending. But we have a 14 trillion dollar economy. The amount of government spending needed to get the needle moving in the right direction is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.6 to 1.8 trillion dollars. Or around 10% of GDP. There is no political will to get that done no matter how hard Obama tries. I don't care who is President, the bad economy will stay with us. Unless the private money out there decides to start getting back into the market, we are stuck in a Japanese Style depression/deflation. Let's just hope that we get out of this before 2016 or 2018 because that is the best case scenario at this point. It will only happen if the Fed decides to do around a 4 to 6 trillion dollar quantitative easing over a 4 year period starting in 2011. I doubt they will do more than 2 trillion dollars before getting themselves spooked. Therefore we are not getting out of this until at least 2022 or later. Heck the Japanese economy is still stuck after 16 to 18 years. I hope I am wrong but I know I am not!! So what does it matter who is President. Even Obama will be gone by 2018 even if he wins and we will still be stuck in this quicksand. You can thank the last 40 years of Republican ideology for this outcome. They are the ones that have convinced a large majority of people that government spending in any situation is bad. So instead of the pragmatic Americans we have become the stuck in the mud Americans.

Not even Obama, who got elected by accident because republicans pushed him up in the primaries with the belief that Obama will be dumped in the general election by McCain-Palin.

Well they can cut taxes. But in this poor economy any tax savings will be saved or used to pay down debt not used to buy new products and services. What is left? More government spending. But we have a 14 trillion dollar economy. The amount of government spending needed to get the needle moving in the right direction is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.6 to 1.8 trillion dollars. Or around 10% of GDP. There is no political will to get that done no matter how hard Obama tries. I don't care who is President, the bad economy will stay with us. Unless the private money out there decides to start getting back into the market, we are stuck in a Japanese Style depression/deflation. Let's just hope that we get out of this before 2016 or 2018 because that is the best case scenario at this point. It will only happen if the Fed decides to do around a 4 to 6 trillion dollar quantitative easing over a 4 year period starting in 2011. I doubt they will do more than 2 trillion dollars before getting themselves spooked. Therefore we are not getting out of this until at least 2022 or later. Heck the Japanese economy is still stuck after 16 to 18 years. I hope I am wrong but I know I am not!! So what does it matter who is President.

But we have a 14 trillion dollar economy. The amount of government spending needed to get the needle moving in the right direction is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.6 to 1.8 trillion dollars.

Let's just hope that we get out of this before 2016 or 2018 because that is the best case scenario at this point. It will only happen if the Fed decides to do around a 4 to 6 trillion dollar quantitative easing over a 4 year period starting in 2011. I doubt they will do more than 2 trillion dollars before getting themselves spooked. Therefore we are not getting out of this until at least 2022 or later.

In fact, I expect that BO will get much worse, and in short order be as irrelevant as a President can be. This little bit of PR is a statement by some forces that Hillary and Bill are becoming giddy with anticipation regarding the 'opportunities' in 2012."
1008,Woodward  - anything to sell his books.  He has to stir the pot.   We called Biden Pennsylvania's 3rd Senator.  Biden is the working persons real deal in the White House.   What a mess Obama and Biden inherited.  God protect us from the Bush's team of liers and Wall Street criminals.  Never again.  
1009,"How about Hillary for the Preseident, Obama to the Dean of some college who want to have him.  JBiden for the US Ambassador to the China and Guitoner for the VP of Goldman or Chaise (he wants).  Hilary can select some one better for the VP and Secretary of the States."
1010,"Ah yes, let's swap Biden and Hillary. After all, they've both done such an outstanding job.<br />Bob Woodward has also stated on record that Obama doesn't listen a lick to Hillary's opinions or advice as Secretary of State."
1011,"I don't know if you realize this, but it's not really that Obama has done a horrible job. It's simpky that people are not happy with politics and society in general and tend to blame whichever party is in power. Obama isn't what damaged the Democratic party, it's them having power that damaged them. It happened to both Dems and Reps the last few times they had control. What needs to be done can't be done so long as people worry about re-election and popular opinion, which in turn hurts both."
1012,"IF, there were a swap in the works it would only be effective upon some conditions.<br />First, if Hillary can pull off what every recent Secretary of State failed to do; that is find a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Second bring the Afghanistan conflict to a definable final conclusion. She could be Queen of the World.<br />With Biden in the Secretary of State position he would be effective on the remaining Terrorism front domestic and abroad.

1013,the whole administration will change jobs on jan 20 2013
1014,"Yes, we need another Clinton in the White House. Hillary is smart, serious and work with a lot of common sense. Bill Clinton was the best president in the last 50 years. He could have being the best president ever in the US history, but ""Moni-L"" got in the middle of something stupid that damaged his reputation as an outstanding president. However, still today, Bill is the most popular former president ever!!<br />Therefore, the democrats might lose the next election because center-minded people are running away from liberals and from politicians like ""Palin, Paladino &amp; Paul"". What a disgrace!! Biden is not helping Obama with any kind of good image or idea. Obama needs a good running mate like Hillary. So what! What is the big deal to dump Biden? If that is the case, then such swap should be considered seriously without any critical speculation, such as Woodward's approah to disclose such good idea so early, just beacuse he is looking for headlines, as usual.<br />In my opinion, the Clintons are more closer to the middle class and independent families in this country that any other politician in USA. Not even Obama, who got elected by accident because republicans pushed him up in the primaries with the belief that Obama will be dumped in the general election by McCain-Palin. Wait for the results in November-2010 and we will see ""who is who"" again in the American feelings. If the ""liberal"" are only 20% of the voters, then the ""PPP party"" (Palin, Paladino &amp; Paul) are another 20%. No more!! We, the rest 60%, are in the real middle of the American society and Hillary is a good representative of this segment!! "
1015,Is this even constitutionally legal? Isn't the VP elected?
1016,Why would anybody be surprised or upset by this possiblity. It makes a lot of sense. 
1017,"A non-story created by someone out to promote his book.  ""nuf said. "

The difference in 2008 was young voters and the difference in 2012 will be young voters. As we go into the 2012 election Obama will remind young voters that he has delivered for them on college loans, health care (staying on parents plan until 26), the environment, and drawing down on two wars. If he can motivate young people again 2012 will look like 2008. "
1022,"So Woodward is taking a two year old quote by someone not in the administration and projecting it on today's situation.  Hardly behavior one would attribute to a ""world class"" journalist."

Why not say someone mentioned Michelle would make a better President and suggest people are thinking of Obama resigning in his wife's favor?  It's as newsworthy.  "
1024,How about Hillary and Obama exchanging jobs? Today.
1025,"I like this move, too.  Lots of people despise the Clintons and this will make it easier to beat Obama in 2012.  Not that his opponent will need much help after another two years of failed socialistic experiments."
1026,"What has Obama done that pisses off everybody? The usual answer is it is more about what he hasn't done and mainly about the poor job market. What can government do about that? Well they can cut taxes. But in this poor economy any tax savings will be saved or used to pay down debt not used to buy new products and services. What is left? More government spending. But we have a 14 trillion dollar economy. The amount of government spending needed to get the needle moving in the right direction is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.6 to 1.8 trillion dollars. Or around 10% of GDP. There is no political will to get that done no matter how hard Obama tries. I don't care who is President, the bad economy will stay with us. Unless the private money out there decides to start getting back into the market, we are stuck in a Japanese Style depression/deflation. Let's just hope that we get out of this before 2016 or 2018 because that is the best case scenario at this point. It will only happen if the Fed decides to do around a 4 to 6 trillion dollar quantitative easing over a 4 year period starting in 2011. I doubt they will do more than 2 trillion dollars before getting themselves spooked. Therefore we are not getting out of this until at least 2022 or later. Heck the Japanese economy is still stuck after 16 to 18 years. I hope I am wrong but I know I am not!! So what does it matter who is President. Even Obama will be gone by 2018 even if he wins and we will still be stuck in this quicksand. You can thank the last 40 years of Republican ideology for this outcome. They are the ones that have convinced a large majority of people that government spending in any situation is bad. So instead of the pragmatic Americans we have become the stuck in the mud Americans. Good job Repubs!"

If that is the case, then such swap should be considered seriously without any critical speculation, such as Woodward's approah to disclose such good idea so early, just beacuse he is looking for headlines, as usual.<br />In my opinion, the Clintons are more closer to the middle class and independent families in this country that any other politician in USA. Not even Obama, who got elected by accident because republicans pushed him up in the primaries with the belief that Obama will be dumped in the general election by McCain-Palin. Wait for the results in November-2010 and we will see ""who is who"" again in the American feelings.

1513,I like it. Smart by Obama. #10<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Let me put this simply:  It's not true!  Get it? 
1514,"I like it. Smart by Obama. Biden is invisible in this administration and unelectable in 2012, this would cap off his only major competition. Things have not been great or awful under Obama so I don't see a republican pulling an upset unless there is a dark horse on the horizon. The sarah pahlin farce needs to end."
1515,"Hmm, SOMEBODY has a clever marketing agent for his book..."
1516,The swap shouldn't be Biden/Clinton.  It should be Obama/Clinton.
1517,<br />Joe Biden would make an even worse Secretary of State than he has been a VP.
1518,"The switch would have to be Biden's idea.  Vice Presidency for Secretary of State.    This may sound funny, but the country likes Biden too much to be okay with Obama pushing him out."
1519,Who cares?  I'm still on the topic of where are the jobs?  
1520,"As long as Obama's approval rating keeps falling, than Hillary will be in line for VP. I don't expect Obama to change, so I don't expect Biden to be back.<br /><br />Someone has to pay for this disastrous Presidency, and it sure as heck won't be Barry.<br />"
1521,This speculation is just to make jp happy.<br /><br />I don't like it. How many times do you expect Hillary to sacrifice for the democratic party ? She can't be VP.She's well known and respected throughout the world. She will not surrender all her hard work for the boredom of playing second banana to President Obama.<br /><br />It ain't gonna happen ! 
1522,Of course there's nothing to it but that won't stop the speculation and mindless internet chatter.  Yet another distraction.
1523,"We've just had 2 years of Clintonesque, Republican-lite economic policy, and it has failed to work (because it was too centrist.)  So why should we want another Clinton.  Biden seems to be the only one in the White House who cares about the regular person.  At this point, I would trade Hillary for Obama---her policies would be the same , but at least she would be willing to fight---but not for Biden. "
1524,"I am amazed at how many professional and amateur pundits thing Obama is in trouble. He numbers are not that bad considering that we are coming out of the Great Recession. The difference in 2008 was young voters and the difference in 2012 will be young voters. As we go into the 2012 election Obama will remind young voters that he has delivered for them on college loans, health care (staying on parents plan until 26), the environment, and drawing down on two wars. If he can motivate young people again 2012 will look like 2008. "
1525,"So Woodward is taking a two year old quote by someone not in the administration and projecting it on today's situation.  Hardly behavior one would attribute to a ""world class"" journalist."
1526,"This is REDICULOUS!  Two years ago Penn thought about it, so Woodward gets to imply it's a possibility, and cable (and the Times)  report it as something newsworthy?

So now it is imperative to survey?  The horse is out..... close the barn door!  If government would get out of the business of price fixing (illegal in any other business), the market would adjust to competition or perish.  MD's who capitulate to government wage dictates choose to slowly perish, or choose not to participate and continue their profession.

If you can't pay at once, you will be hounded, believe me, to bankruptcy and beyond.  And you will hear scornful wealthier people tell you that they ""pay for the uninsured.""  <br/><br/>But I don't think Obama cares to hear it.

2059,"I believe one of the reasons Obama won over Hillary for Democratic candidate was that he downplayed the race card and she emphasized gender card.  The fact is that poor and middle class Americans have it hard and most are sick of hearing about the petty slights of privileged white women and black men.  It is only in academia, the upper classes, and social justice culture where these things are at the forefront.  People are barely getting by.  Stop the identity politics.  I am sick of the last 8 years of obsession with all racial slights against blacks, no matter how petty, being treated like a national crisis.  There are bigots in all groups, including the left.  If electing Hillary meant 8 years of the gender card and media obsession with finding sexism under every rock, then I may not vote.  The left is losing supporters left and right due to its obsession with finding bigotry under every rock and holding it up to the light.  "
2060,"Women today are the recipients of nearly 60 percent of all undergraduate degrees in the U.S.and 60 percent of all graduate and professional degrees. <br/><br/>Mrs. Clinton should this time stress gender. It is her gender that is going to lead this country through much of this century, whether in business or government. Women need to do that and men will just have to get used to it because there are not going to be enough men with the educational background and preparation to lead across the entire work spectra.<br/><br/>As to Mrs. Clinton, her qualifications and accomplishments or not, she has more than enough and more than most ever do, and certainly more and better than any of the likely Republicans seeking the presidency, to be president.<br/><br/>And there will be one and only one choice: Mrs. Clinton or her Republican opponent; Mrs. Clinton appointing several thousand federal officials and all of the federal judiciary including as many as five members of the SCOTUS or a<br/>Republican doing that; Mrs. Clinton delivering State of the Union addresses laying out a legislative program, or a Republican doing that; Mrs. Clinton as commander and diplomat in chief, or a Republican.<br/><br/>That is the contest. How she gets there and what she messages and policies she builds her campaign on are fine with me, as long as she comes out of it elected president with the all the authority to do all the things a president can do.<br/><br/>If in doing so obviously she changes the status of women forever, that is all to the good."
2061,"Give gender more of a role in 16???  That is one of the major reasons she lost in 2008 to Obama...he ran as an American not as a Black.<br/><br/>She ran as a woman not as an American.<br/><br/>It would turn off more and more men and start to alienate women too...who want an American in the White House not just a woman.<br/><br/>Add this to her monumental blunder voting for the Iraq 2 War, her support of Wall Street  and she is looking more and more like somebody who repeats blunders.<br/><br/>There is no fool like an old fool..."
2062,"In the very next article in the times about Hillary's talk in the Silicon Valley, it is noted that Chelsea Clinton is a board member of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActive Corp what is a media corporation...what media skill and background does Chelsea have except for being a Clinton? Oh yes, and Barry Diller arranged a private round table with an impressive number of Silicon Valley chiefs for Hillary....good work Chelsea!"
2063,"Mrs. Clinton has the same memory problems as Brian Williams causing her to remember  ""dodging bullets"" in a war zone while she while she was first lady. Brian Williams has the same memory issue regarding dodging bullets but he has been suspended and may not return to his anchor job...Yet Hillary while losing the primary in '08 gets to come back and try again using ""the gender issue"" as a trump card.  Let's leave  the running of the country to a woman or a man with a better track record remembering the facts. Brian Williams need not apply.<br/>"" "
2064,"She's a chameleon who changes her color in order to attract the most voters. Unfortunately, it appears she is the candidate that the Democrats will run. In the same vein, it appears that Bush will be the Republican choice. Same old same old. What an uninspiring election; two cardBoard cutouts. Let's hope either one picks a good cabinet. Now we'll have to rely on the Congress for great leadership. God help us! "

2066,"The problem with the relic argument for Republicans is threefold. She obviously isn't a relic, their patron Saint Ronnie was the same age when he ran for the presidency, and a large segment of their voters ARE relics. And yes of course gender is going to play a huge role. Firstly, the US is essentially a matriarchy, there are more female voters than male and many are itching to say Madam President, and finally there is the general US taste for novelty. No wonder Republicans are in despair.   "

2068,Why is the former Secretary of State Clinton is identified as Mrs. Clinton in this article? The NYT doesn't identify he marital status of any other woman in the article. Do you think we have trouble differentiating between she and her husband?
2069,"There are quite a few crabby comments amongst the NYT picks today. Since when have we decided that foregrounding gender -- or any identity category -- is some sort of non-starter? Most of the major candidates never have to mention this because they are all the SAME; they all have the same gender, economic, and ethnic bias. What is wrong with mentioning that a difference in any one of those categories might actually make you more empathetic or more representative?"
2070,"First of all, if the Clinton campaign team thinks not emphasizing gender was on of their most crucial mistakes last time, they're out of their minds - the big mistakes were fighting over who would be what in the Clinton Administration before she was even nominated and failing to even consider how she could be beaten. <br/><br/>Second, see this - <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/politics/06voters.html"" title=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/politics/06voters.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/politics/06voters.html</a>. The headline from 8 years ago is ""Clinton plans major appeal to women"" and makes it clear she did not downplay gender. So we've got a wee bit of revisionism going on. Failing to learn from the past is a bad sign for the future."
2071,"""It will involve frequent references to being a mother and grandmother and to how her family has inspired her to embrace policies that she believes would help middle-class families."" This is good of course. Can she also include working class and the poor? "
2072,"Aesop wrote,"" familiarity breeds contempt "". That's what critics are saying about Hillary Clinton. We can't have her as president because she has just been around too long.Let's get rid of Pepsi and Apple and Ford and...""<br/><br/>Why does this have to be the case? Why not give Hillary a chance to prove herself during the campaign? Why not have an open mind?<br/><br/>""Minds are like parachutes. They only function when open"". (Dewar)"
2073,"Secretary Clinton isn't perfect, but she has substantially more presidential experience than any of her predecessors, including her husband.  And, with the significant exception of Vice President Biden, Secretary Clinton has more experience than any of her key competitors in either party.<br/><br/>I am not always a Hillary Clinton fan, but I'd say that she has won the right to campaign on a platform of being the best prepared/ most experienced 2016 presidential contender, as well as on the appeal of breaking the glass ceiling surrounding the presidency."
2074,"If anyone can cite one major accomplishment by Hillary Clinton as either senator or secretary of state, then I'd love to know what it is. There is no absolutely reason why she should have the nomination handed to her, but it seems that because of superpacs, we the little people will have no say in the matter.<br/><br/>One can almost feel Bill pushing her from behind, probably because his existential angst over infidelities and predation will not be assuaged until she is sitting behind the desk in the oval office. Most people would be proud of a career in public service such that a term in the senate and one as secretary of state would be sufficient. Not the Clintons, because their quest for money and power is insatiable.<br/><br/>Please, it's somebody else's turn!"
2075,"Mrs. Clinton is a wife, mother, and grandmother. She will be a president too soon. There is nothing to hide.  Be yourself and pride!"
2076,"What do those listed below have in common - that Mrs. Clinton does not have? <br/><br/>Each ran on her own - without lying for a famous husband impeached - a man leading to part the waters...none of theirs were husbands that were impeached for sexual misconduct and a cover up. <br/><br/>Did not Mrs. Clinton get there by lying for her husband?<br/><br/>Do we really need Mrs. Clinton, can we not do better than Jib Bush?<br/><br/>Is name recognition all there is.. <br/><br/>Can The New York Times find a way to explore the others out there? <br/><br/>Please!!!<br/><br/>The list: Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson."
2077," She's all for fronting a persona which she and her handlers think will win her the White House. She's something today, but a totally different one tomorrow. I dare any of her supporters to tell me which Hillary there will be this time next year. Or more importantly, which one they will get if, god forbid, she's the president.<br/>It's very telling that with all the money at her disposal, all the publicists at her beck and call, all the favorable coverage the NYT have availed her, Hillary has trouble convincing the average Joe, or Becky, to like her.<br/>She lacks what no amount of money can buy: authenticity."
2078,"The emphasis should NOT be on Clinton being a woman, but rather on her willingness to fight FOR women's rights. I will vote for whoever will do that, regardless of whether the person is male or female themselves. <br/><br/>The problem is that so far no other candidates are willing to fight for women's rights, and in fact most candidates will continue the backlash on women's rights. So if it takes a women to fight, fine, whoever it is, we need someone to make sure our rights do not slide back, someone who will not put more sexist conservatives  on the Supreme Court. "
2079,"Unfortunately, Mrs. Clinton's style, carriage, presentation and tone of voice are so fabulously annoying that she really ought to keep a very low campaign profile and hand-out the least number of sound-bites possible.  When courting women, well, her speeches are just sung to the choir--aren't they?  Although, because Mr. Obama did so very little for the black community, Hillary needs be careful not to fill women's ears with what will amount to false promises.<br/><br/>Wage equality?  Sure, just as soon as that movement can come-up with numbers proving a woman's out-put equality, her corporate ROI equality and years spent stick with the job equality.  Is the corporation's expenditure on her health care equal to that of a man's? or is she costing a company more? sick days missed? days arriving late and leaving early, are these more, less or equal to a man's?<br/><br/>Sorry to jump into cold hard reality in Devil's Advocate form, but corporations aren't just going to raise the pay of females some 17% because either Hillary Clinton or Patricia Arquette loud-mouths about it.  The corporations are going to runs numbers and determine a woman's actual wort--compared to that of a man.  Then, of course, they will continue to pay father's more, pay golfers more, slip fringe benefits to guys who go bowling with the boys--listen, I sure wouldn't hold my breadth just because Hillary goes into campaign mode."
2080,"Mrs./First Lady (twice)/Secretary/Senator Clinton, certainly does have a fine line to walk.  If she is too assertive at emphasizing her being a Female, she will distract voters--even other Women--from focusing on her Presidential potential.  Also, if she strived to avoid the point, she might appear to be subservient and loose the specific characteristic that only she, at least so far, appears to offer.<br/><br/>Also, having run before--against (now) President Obama in 2008--she will have just one more credential to offer.  Either way, I'm sure that there will be some adversaries and pundits who will still focus on:  her hair style; her choice of clothiers and, of course, the cut of her jib.  But if so, those (probably) Men will do so at their own peril.<br/><br/><a href=""http://thetruthoncommonsense.com"" title=""http://thetruthoncommonsense.com"" target=""_blank"">http://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a>"
2081,"If there's ONE american voter who has not seen or heard Mrs Clinton before ... that's one irrelevant non-voter.<br/>Mrs Clinton would do well to forget the tactics and playbooks, where 'Strategies' become just another form for manipulation.<br/>Be 'real' Mrs Clinton. The world knows you already, just be who you are. And will finally be able to refer to 'my' Madam President. "
2082,"In the U.S., women now account for half of all jobs, with sweeping consequences , they are becoming the primary breadwinners, bringing home the majority of the family's earnings, and answering the baby's cry  at Three o'clock in the morning. Mrs. Clinton is going after that vote."

2084,"Women today are the recipients of nearly 60 percent of all undergraduate degrees in the U.S.and 60 percent of all graduate and professional degrees. <br/><br/>Mrs. Clinton should this time stress gender.

Women need to do that and men will just have to get used to it because there are not going to be enough men with the educational background and preparation to lead across the entire work spectra.<br/><br/>As to Mrs. Clinton, her qualifications and accomplishments or not, she has more than enough and more than most ever do, and certainly more and better than any of the likely Republicans seeking the presidency, to be president.<br/><br/>And there will be one and only one choice: Mrs. Clinton or her Republican opponent; Mrs. Clinton appointing several thousand federal officials and all of the federal judiciary including as many as five members of the SCOTUS or a<br/>Republican doing that; Mrs. Clinton delivering State of the Union addresses laying out a legislative program, or a Republican doing that; Mrs. Clinton as commander and diplomat in chief, or a Republican.<br/><br/>That is the contest. How she gets there and what she messages and policies she builds her campaign on are fine with me, as long as she comes out of it elected president with the all the authority to do all the things a president can do.<br/><br/>If in doing so obviously she changes the status of women forever, that is all to the good."

2102,"The emphasis should NOT be on Clinton being a woman, but rather on her willingness to fight FOR women's rights. I will vote for whoever will do that, regardless of whether the person is male or female themselves. <br/><br/>The problem is that so far no other candidates are willing to fight for women's rights, and in fact most candidates will continue the backlash on women's rights. So if it takes a women to fight, fine, whoever it is, we need someone to make sure our rights do not slide back, someone who will not put more sexist conservatives  on the Supreme Court. "
2103,"Unfortunately, Mrs. Clinton's style, carriage, presentation and tone of voice are so fabulously annoying that she really ought to keep a very low campaign profile and hand-out the least number of sound-bites possible.

Although, because Mr. Obama did so very little for the black community, Hillary needs be careful not to fill women's ears with what will amount to false promises.<br/><br/>Wage equality?  Sure, just as soon as that movement can come-up with numbers proving a woman's out-put equality, her corporate ROI equality and years spent stick with the job equality.  Is the corporation's expenditure on her health care equal to that of a man's? or is she costing a company more? sick days missed? days arriving late and leaving early, are these more, less or equal to a man's?<br/><br/>Sorry to jump into cold hard reality in Devil's Advocate form, but corporations aren't just going to raise the pay of females some 17% because either Hillary Clinton or Patricia Arquette loud-mouths about it.  The corporations are going to runs numbers and determine a woman's actual wort--compared to that of a man.

2104,"Mrs./First Lady (twice)/Secretary/Senator Clinton, certainly does have a fine line to walk.

Either way, I'm sure that there will be some adversaries and pundits who will still focus on:  her hair style; her choice of clothiers and, of course, the cut of her jib.

If she's ready to advocate for women, I'll then be ""ready for Hillary."""
2157,So the candidate who wants to run on her gender chose to pay female staffers 72% of what she paid male staffers according to recent stories.<br/><br/>One of two things have to be true.

Methinks she is over the hill
2158,"By the logic of the American electorate, we should elect Hillary Clinton despite her awful record as Secretary of State, for her mishandling of health care reform during her husband's term of presidency, and for her obligations to the oligarchy, so that we can be show that a woman, like a black man, can be as awful a president as a white man.  There would be a beautiful symmetry:  8 years of George W. Bush, then 8 years of Barack H. Obama, followed by 8 years of Hillary R. Clinton.  After that:  put a fork in the US of A.  Because we are done!<br/><br/>I voted for Jill Stein in 2012, and expect to do so again in 2016.  Want a woman president?

Brian Williams has the same memory issue regarding dodging bullets but he has been suspended and may not return to his anchor job...Yet Hillary while losing the primary in '08 gets to come back and try again using ""the gender issue"" as a trump card.  Let's leave  the running of the country to a woman or a man with a better track record remembering the facts. Brian Williams need not apply.<br/>"" "
2160,"She's a chameleon who changes her color in order to attract the most voters. Unfortunately, it appears she is the candidate that the Democrats will run.

So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2534,"The emphasis should NOT be on Clinton being a woman, but rather on her willingness to fight FOR women's rights. I will vote for whoever will do that, regardless of whether the person is male or female themselves. <br/><br/>The problem is that so far no other candidates are willing to fight for women's rights, and in fact most candidates will continue the backlash on women's rights.

The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."

The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.

And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
2584,"Mrs./First Lady (twice)/Secretary/Senator Clinton, certainly does have a fine line to walk.  If she is too assertive at emphasizing her being a Female, she will distract voters--even other Women--from focusing on her Presidential potential.  Also, if she strived to avoid the point, she might appear to be subservient and loose the specific characteristic that only she, at least so far, appears to offer.<br/><br/>Also, having run before--against (now) President Obama in 2008--she will have just one more credential to offer.  Either way, I'm sure that there will be some adversaries and pundits who will still focus on:  her hair style; her choice of clothiers and, of course, the cut of her jib.

If she's ready to advocate for women, I'll then be ""ready for Hillary."""
2589,So the candidate who wants to run on her gender chose to pay female staffers 72% of what she paid male staffers according to recent stories.<br/><br/>One of two things have to be true. Either the calculation which measures male vs female compensation is defective or the latest champion of gender inequality has personally benefited by mistreating members of her own gender.<br/>Sad that HRC is described to be the best torchbearer to represent the unmet  interests of the new generation.

2595,"Hillary, fire all your campaign workers and save a lot of money. You can then also avoid any appearance of favoritism to Wall Street or foreign countries.

2597,"I am looking forward to the 2016 campaign.  In my lifetime I have become incredibly disillusioned and cynical listening to entitled men holding forth  ~  night and day on radio, television, in writing, on and on.  It would be great to have a whole field of women running in the Presidential primaries, Republican and Democratic.  Can't you just picture 7 Republican women on stage for the Presidential candidates'  debates in 2016?  It would be so amazing.  Hilary Clinton needs to prove herself worthy of our vote, but no more and no less than any other candidate.  However, if we get another  ""government-can-do-no-good &amp; if you vote for me, I'll prove it"" candidate from the right, as appears likely, she could do very well.  "

2658,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman. A wealthy well-connected woman whose husband was president gets elected? Were you impressed when a former mayor's wife who headed the garden club became town treasurer then mayor? American politics is utterly depressing and broken. Clemanceau said that America went from barbarism to decadence without the intervening step of civilization. Warren, please but not that aspiring rapacious empty pantsuit. "
2659,"Forgive me this lightweight comment but HRC is going to be President of the United States because ""she is ready"", and, America is ready for her"".  She can and will raise two billion dollars and nothing can stop that cash from her campaign. The people on the other side (RNC) are so unprepared with zero brains or other capabilities to stop her. "
2660,"It's one thing not to back off from your gender, but it's another thing to embrace gender issues.  The other night the actress Patricia Arquette illustrated the difference as she accepted her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress by urging ""pay equality"" for women.  Will Hillary take up this and other issues like reproductive rights that have been under attack by Republicans across to country?  if she does, then women and many men will respond, but if she plays the usual coy Clinton game by extolling the cuddly feminine of grand-motherhood,  she'll be seen as old and out of touch.  If she's ready to advocate for women, I'll then be ""ready for Hillary."""
2661,So the candidate who wants to run on her gender chose to pay female staffers 72% of what she paid male staffers according to recent stories.<br/><br/>One of two things have to be true. Either the calculation which measures male vs female compensation is defective or the latest champion of gender inequality has personally benefited by mistreating members of her own gender.<br/>Sad that HRC is described to be the best torchbearer to represent the unmet  interests of the new generation.  Methinks she is over the hill
2662,"By the logic of the American electorate, we should elect Hillary Clinton despite her awful record as Secretary of State, for her mishandling of health care reform during her husband's term of presidency, and for her obligations to the oligarchy, so that we can be show that a woman, like a black man, can be as awful a president as a white man.  There would be a beautiful symmetry:  8 years of George W. Bush, then 8 years of Barack H. Obama, followed by 8 years of Hillary R. Clinton.  After that:  put a fork in the US of A.  Because we are done!<br/><br/>I voted for Jill Stein in 2012, and expect to do so again in 2016.  Want a woman president?  Why not vote for an ethical, honest person who is more concerned about our future than pandering for votes?"
2663,"Will the voters fall for this gender stuff?  Of course, they are just that stupid.  Perhaps Gruber was right.  Think about it, the election may turn on the transgender vote.  I am thinking of declaring myself transgender or gender-less.  I can't wait for the next application I must fill out  so I can cross out male, female and write in 'neutral'.  This will be fun. "
2664,"Given the Supreme Court and the age of the justices, I would prefer a Democrat to a Republican. The moderate Republicans appear to be endangered. That said, I supported Hillary in 2008, but I'm not sure now. My main concern is that many people seem to have their minds made up. Can Hillary beat another Bush or would Republicans be extra motivated?  It would be nice to have people run who AREN'T related to previous presidents."
2665,"After the realization that there is virtually no distance between the actual policies of Hillary Clinton and any of the likely candidates the GOP will run against her, her triangulation specialists and pollsters have determined that gender is the only real differentiator.  Democracy is long dead, replaced by marketing specialists who brilliantly obfuscate the fact that both parties are financed and owned by a small group of oligarchs and plutocrats. "
2666,One wonders what kind of back room deal Hillary made with Elizabeth Warren to keep her from running.
2667,"Hillary, fire all your campaign workers and save a lot of money. You can then also avoid any appearance of favoritism to Wall Street or foreign countries. Your campaign is being well managed by the media, who will publish continuous gushing articles about you, while treating you Republican opponents with ruthless ferocity. Give the savings to your foundation. "
2668,"I have no intention of voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a woman.  If I vote for her, it will be because of her record and her program for the future.<br/>It's insulting to voters for a candidate to play the ""gender card"" just as it is to play the ""race card"" or any other ""card""."
2669,"I am looking forward to the 2016 campaign.  In my lifetime I have become incredibly disillusioned and cynical listening to entitled men holding forth  ~  night and day on radio, television, in writing, on and on.  It would be great to have a whole field of women running in the Presidential primaries, Republican and Democratic.  Can't you just picture 7 Republican women on stage for the Presidential candidates'  debates in 2016?  It would be so amazing.  Hilary Clinton needs to prove herself worthy of our vote, but no more and no less than any other candidate.  However, if we get another  ""government-can-do-no-good &amp; if you vote for me, I'll prove it"" candidate from the right, as appears likely, she could do very well.  "
2670,"thank goodness Hillary is a grandmother...this assures the line of succession on the Democrat side... fortunately, I won't still be around to vote during the Chelsea vs. Jenna election of 2036"
2671,"Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson.<br/>I sincerely wish Mrs. Clinton the best, but what was that about breaking new ground again? Oh, I forgot - in THIS country. We've a bit of catching up to do, it appears."
2672,Would much rather have the first Latina First Lady than more Clintons
2673,"In 2008 (and 2012), I voted for Barack because he was the best candidate.   Why is being a woman a qualification for one's vote?"
2674," I take Hilary to be a technocrat, if I'm using the word correctly.  That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "
2675,"Casting a vote for a female presidential candidate, with gender being the primary qualification is completely legitimate in my view.  But, for many other reasons, Hillary is the wrong candidate.  I would gladly cast my vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I would never vote for Hillary Clinton."
2676,"Hillary may be surprised to know that here have been leaders of both genders throughout history. Sorry, she is a globalist who now finds importance in being American, once again, tailored for her historic ascent. What difference at this point, does it make? "
2677,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2678,So is this to be the substitute for a real economic program and a rational foreign policy? 
2679,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."

2683,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it. Now that we know that was an extremely hurtful ideology which had a devastating affect on the lives of mainstream women, she'll want to soft-pedal the notion that women should go into the labor force and compete with men for their lives and livelihoods here in America. Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."

Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
2732,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
2733,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
2734,"By the logic of the American electorate, we should elect Hillary Clinton despite her awful record as Secretary of State, for her mishandling of health care reform during her husband's term of presidency, and for her obligations to the oligarchy, so that we can be show that a woman, like a black man, can be as awful a president as a white man.  There would be a beautiful symmetry:  8 years of George W. Bush, then 8 years of Barack H. Obama, followed by 8 years of Hillary R. Clinton.  After that:  put a fork in the US of A.  Because we are done!<br/><br/>I voted for Jill Stein in 2012, and expect to do so again in 2016.  Want a woman president?  Why not vote for an ethical, honest person who is more concerned about our future than pandering for votes?"
2735,"Will the voters fall for this gender stuff?  Of course, they are just that stupid.  Perhaps Gruber was right.  Think about it, the election may turn on the transgender vote.  I am thinking of declaring myself transgender or gender-less.  I can't wait for the next application I must fill out  so I can cross out male, female and write in 'neutral'.  This will be fun. "
2736,"Given the Supreme Court and the age of the justices, I would prefer a Democrat to a Republican. The moderate Republicans appear to be endangered. That said, I supported Hillary in 2008, but I'm not sure now. My main concern is that many people seem to have their minds made up. Can Hillary beat another Bush or would Republicans be extra motivated?  It would be nice to have people run who AREN'T related to previous presidents."
2737,"After the realization that there is virtually no distance between the actual policies of Hillary Clinton and any of the likely candidates the GOP will run against her, her triangulation specialists and pollsters have determined that gender is the only real differentiator.  Democracy is long dead, replaced by marketing specialists who brilliantly obfuscate the fact that both parties are financed and owned by a small group of oligarchs and plutocrats. "
2738,One wonders what kind of back room deal Hillary made with Elizabeth Warren to keep her from running.
2739,"Hillary, fire all your campaign workers and save a lot of money. You can then also avoid any appearance of favoritism to Wall Street or foreign countries. Your campaign is being well managed by the media, who will publish continuous gushing articles about you, while treating you Republican opponents with ruthless ferocity. Give the savings to your foundation. "
2740,"I have no intention of voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a woman.  If I vote for her, it will be because of her record and her program for the future.<br/>It's insulting to voters for a candidate to play the ""gender card"" just as it is to play the ""race card"" or any other ""card""."
2741,"I am looking forward to the 2016 campaign.  In my lifetime I have become incredibly disillusioned and cynical listening to entitled men holding forth  ~  night and day on radio, television, in writing, on and on.  It would be great to have a whole field of women running in the Presidential primaries, Republican and Democratic.  Can't you just picture 7 Republican women on stage for the Presidential candidates'  debates in 2016?  It would be so amazing.  Hilary Clinton needs to prove herself worthy of our vote, but no more and no less than any other candidate.  However, if we get another  ""government-can-do-no-good &amp; if you vote for me, I'll prove it"" candidate from the right, as appears likely, she could do very well.  "
2742,"thank goodness Hillary is a grandmother...this assures the line of succession on the Democrat side... fortunately, I won't still be around to vote during the Chelsea vs. Jenna election of 2036"
2743,"Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson.<br/>I sincerely wish Mrs. Clinton the best, but what was that about breaking new ground again? Oh, I forgot - in THIS country. We've a bit of catching up to do, it appears."
2744,Would much rather have the first Latina First Lady than more Clintons
2745,"In 2008 (and 2012), I voted for Barack because he was the best candidate.   Why is being a woman a qualification for one's vote?"
2746," I take Hilary to be a technocrat, if I'm using the word correctly.  That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "
2747,"Casting a vote for a female presidential candidate, with gender being the primary qualification is completely legitimate in my view.  But, for many other reasons, Hillary is the wrong candidate.  I would gladly cast my vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I would never vote for Hillary Clinton."
2748,"Hillary may be surprised to know that here have been leaders of both genders throughout history. Sorry, she is a globalist who now finds importance in being American, once again, tailored for her historic ascent. What difference at this point, does it make? "
2749,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2750,So is this to be the substitute for a real economic program and a rational foreign policy? 
2751,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
2752,"Hillary reminds me of that smart person in High School who was President of the National Honor Society and graduating class Valedictorian. Very impressive, indeed, but is that the right person to be President of the United States?"
2753,I think It is OK to talk about gender. But more importantly I want an authentic candidate.
2754,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman. A wealthy well-connected woman whose husband was president gets elected? Were you impressed when a former mayor's wife who headed the garden club became town treasurer then mayor? American politics is utterly depressing and broken. Clemanceau said that America went from barbarism to decadence without the intervening step of civilization. Warren, please but not that aspiring rapacious empty pantsuit. "
2755,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it.

I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
2806,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.
2807,"The same people are so excited about having the first woman president would be having the exact opposite reaction if Hillary Clinton were a Republican, married to a former Republican president. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the first woman president. It has everything to do with Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee because the Democrats have a weak bench."
2808,"Do we really want to elect someone who is a woman because she's a woman?  <br/><br/>How does Hillary make the argument work?  That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.  If we elect a woman for being a woman, we're basically saying that we chose the wrong genetic basis for leading the country all these years."
2809,"After the realization that there is virtually no distance between the actual policies of Hillary Clinton and any of the likely candidates the GOP will run against her, her triangulation specialists and pollsters have determined that gender is the only real differentiator.  Democracy is long dead, replaced by marketing specialists who brilliantly obfuscate the fact that both parties are financed and owned by a small group of oligarchs and plutocrats. "
2810,One wonders what kind of back room deal Hillary made with Elizabeth Warren to keep her from running.
2811,"Hillary, fire all your campaign workers and save a lot of money. You can then also avoid any appearance of favoritism to Wall Street or foreign countries. Your campaign is being well managed by the media, who will publish continuous gushing articles about you, while treating you Republican opponents with ruthless ferocity. Give the savings to your foundation. "
2812,"I have no intention of voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a woman.  If I vote for her, it will be because of her record and her program for the future.<br/>It's insulting to voters for a candidate to play the ""gender card"" just as it is to play the ""race card"" or any other ""card""."
2813,"I am looking forward to the 2016 campaign.  In my lifetime I have become incredibly disillusioned and cynical listening to entitled men holding forth  ~  night and day on radio, television, in writing, on and on.  It would be great to have a whole field of women running in the Presidential primaries, Republican and Democratic.  Can't you just picture 7 Republican women on stage for the Presidential candidates'  debates in 2016?  It would be so amazing.  Hilary Clinton needs to prove herself worthy of our vote, but no more and no less than any other candidate.  However, if we get another  ""government-can-do-no-good &amp; if you vote for me, I'll prove it"" candidate from the right, as appears likely, she could do very well.  "
2814,"thank goodness Hillary is a grandmother...this assures the line of succession on the Democrat side... fortunately, I won't still be around to vote during the Chelsea vs. Jenna election of 2036"
2815,"Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson.<br/>I sincerely wish Mrs. Clinton the best, but what was that about breaking new ground again? Oh, I forgot - in THIS country. We've a bit of catching up to do, it appears."
2816,Would much rather have the first Latina First Lady than more Clintons
2817,"In 2008 (and 2012), I voted for Barack because he was the best candidate.   Why is being a woman a qualification for one's vote?"
2818," I take Hilary to be a technocrat, if I'm using the word correctly.  That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "
2819,"Casting a vote for a female presidential candidate, with gender being the primary qualification is completely legitimate in my view.  But, for many other reasons, Hillary is the wrong candidate.  I would gladly cast my vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I would never vote for Hillary Clinton."
2820,"Hillary may be surprised to know that here have been leaders of both genders throughout history. Sorry, she is a globalist who now finds importance in being American, once again, tailored for her historic ascent. What difference at this point, does it make? "
2821,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2822,So is this to be the substitute for a real economic program and a rational foreign policy? 
2823,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
2824,"Hillary reminds me of that smart person in High School who was President of the National Honor Society and graduating class Valedictorian. Very impressive, indeed, but is that the right person to be President of the United States?"
2825,I think It is OK to talk about gender. But more importantly I want an authentic candidate.
2826,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman. A wealthy well-connected woman whose husband was president gets elected? Were you impressed when a former mayor's wife who headed the garden club became town treasurer then mayor? American politics is utterly depressing and broken. Clemanceau said that America went from barbarism to decadence without the intervening step of civilization. Warren, please but not that aspiring rapacious empty pantsuit. "
2827,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it. Now that we know that was an extremely hurtful ideology which had a devastating affect on the lives of mainstream women, she'll want to soft-pedal the notion that women should go into the labor force and compete with men for their lives and livelihoods here in America. Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
2828,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers.

When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
2878,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.
2879,"The same people are so excited about having the first woman president would be having the exact opposite reaction if Hillary Clinton were a Republican, married to a former Republican president. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the first woman president. It has everything to do with Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee because the Democrats have a weak bench."
2880,"Do we really want to elect someone who is a woman because she's a woman?  <br/><br/>How does Hillary make the argument work?  That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.  If we elect a woman for being a woman, we're basically saying that we chose the wrong genetic basis for leading the country all these years."
2881,"Without a clear and absolute statement on Constitutional inclusion and the Equal Rights Amendment then all of this is simple window-dressing... or as Scalia would name it : argle-bargle, simple coy pandering to the base with a focus on not upsetting the Catholic Church, all evangelicals, all fundamentalists, and Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>None of them are going to vote for you, Mrs. Clinton, and neither will I if you are simply talking photo-op. Time to rock n' roll. You in, or, you out?"
2882,"Oh Lord, please don't let the next election be Bush vs Clinton.  "
2883,"Of course--the goal is to demonize her opponents through lackeys while essentially asserting ""vote for me because I'm female"".<br/><br/>The Clintons are beyond shame or embarassment."
2884,"I have no intention of voting for Hillary Clinton because she's a woman.  If I vote for her, it will be because of her record and her program for the future.<br/>It's insulting to voters for a candidate to play the ""gender card"" just as it is to play the ""race card"" or any other ""card""."
2885,"I am looking forward to the 2016 campaign.  In my lifetime I have become incredibly disillusioned and cynical listening to entitled men holding forth  ~  night and day on radio, television, in writing, on and on.  It would be great to have a whole field of women running in the Presidential primaries, Republican and Democratic.  Can't you just picture 7 Republican women on stage for the Presidential candidates'  debates in 2016?  It would be so amazing.  Hilary Clinton needs to prove herself worthy of our vote, but no more and no less than any other candidate.  However, if we get another  ""government-can-do-no-good &amp; if you vote for me, I'll prove it"" candidate from the right, as appears likely, she could do very well.  "
2886,"thank goodness Hillary is a grandmother...this assures the line of succession on the Democrat side... fortunately, I won't still be around to vote during the Chelsea vs. Jenna election of 2036"
2887,"Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson.<br/>I sincerely wish Mrs. Clinton the best, but what was that about breaking new ground again? Oh, I forgot - in THIS country. We've a bit of catching up to do, it appears."
2888,Would much rather have the first Latina First Lady than more Clintons
2889,"In 2008 (and 2012), I voted for Barack because he was the best candidate.   Why is being a woman a qualification for one's vote?"
2890," I take Hilary to be a technocrat, if I'm using the word correctly.  That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "
2891,"Casting a vote for a female presidential candidate, with gender being the primary qualification is completely legitimate in my view.  But, for many other reasons, Hillary is the wrong candidate.  I would gladly cast my vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I would never vote for Hillary Clinton."
2892,"Hillary may be surprised to know that here have been leaders of both genders throughout history. Sorry, she is a globalist who now finds importance in being American, once again, tailored for her historic ascent. What difference at this point, does it make? "
2893,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2894,So is this to be the substitute for a real economic program and a rational foreign policy? 
2895,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
2896,"Hillary reminds me of that smart person in High School who was President of the National Honor Society and graduating class Valedictorian. Very impressive, indeed, but is that the right person to be President of the United States?"
2897,I think It is OK to talk about gender. But more importantly I want an authentic candidate.
2898,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman. A wealthy well-connected woman whose husband was president gets elected? Were you impressed when a former mayor's wife who headed the garden club became town treasurer then mayor? American politics is utterly depressing and broken. Clemanceau said that America went from barbarism to decadence without the intervening step of civilization. Warren, please but not that aspiring rapacious empty pantsuit. "
2899,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it. Now that we know that was an extremely hurtful ideology which had a devastating affect on the lives of mainstream women, she'll want to soft-pedal the notion that women should go into the labor force and compete with men for their lives and livelihoods here in America. Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
2900,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
2901,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.

That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.  If we elect a woman for being a woman, we're basically saying that we chose the wrong genetic basis for leading the country all these years."
2953,"Without a clear and absolute statement on Constitutional inclusion and the Equal Rights Amendment then all of this is simple window-dressing... or as Scalia would name it : argle-bargle, simple coy pandering to the base with a focus on not upsetting the Catholic Church, all evangelicals, all fundamentalists, and Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>None of them are going to vote for you, Mrs. Clinton, and neither will I if you are simply talking photo-op. Time to rock n' roll. You in, or, you out?"
2954,"Oh Lord, please don't let the next election be Bush vs Clinton.  "
2955,"Of course--the goal is to demonize her opponents through lackeys while essentially asserting ""vote for me because I'm female"".<br/><br/>The Clintons are beyond shame or embarassment."
2956,"In response to Nathan B, NYC<br/><br/>Really?<br/>For the first time in the history of the United States of America a woman has the potential to be President and you are going to sit this one out for the first time in your life?<br/>Is it possible you are being sexist in your holding Ms.Clinton to a higher standard than all the men you have voted for?"
2957,"This assumes she's be the nominee a year and a half before the election.  A little  presumptive, a little too self-entitled.  It reminds me of 7 years ago when she and all the people around her thought she couldn't miss."
2958,"Pakistan had a female leader but not the US - yet.  It's past time. But electing a woman president isn't at the top of my list. I distrust Clinton for her corporatism at a time when we need Big Money out of politics and economic reform that would include a big reduction in Corporate Welfare, more room for small business to grow and compete, and tax reform to eliminate differential treatment of investment income and wages, just for a start. Clinton will, at best, slow down the destruction of the last vestiges of the New Deal. As Secretary of State she didn't make a difference.<br/><br/>Not good enough."
2959,"Angela Merkel. Margaret Thatcher. Indira Gandhi. Golda Meir. Michelle Bachelet. Dima Roussef. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gro Harlem Brundtland. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Mary Robinson.<br/>I sincerely wish Mrs. Clinton the best, but what was that about breaking new ground again? Oh, I forgot - in THIS country. We've a bit of catching up to do, it appears."
2960,Would much rather have the first Latina First Lady than more Clintons
2961,"In 2008 (and 2012), I voted for Barack because he was the best candidate.   Why is being a woman a qualification for one's vote?"
2962," I take Hilary to be a technocrat, if I'm using the word correctly.  That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "
2963,"Casting a vote for a female presidential candidate, with gender being the primary qualification is completely legitimate in my view.  But, for many other reasons, Hillary is the wrong candidate.  I would gladly cast my vote for Elizabeth Warren.  I would never vote for Hillary Clinton."
2964,"Hillary may be surprised to know that here have been leaders of both genders throughout history. Sorry, she is a globalist who now finds importance in being American, once again, tailored for her historic ascent. What difference at this point, does it make? "
2965,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."
2966,So is this to be the substitute for a real economic program and a rational foreign policy? 
2967,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
2968,"Hillary reminds me of that smart person in High School who was President of the National Honor Society and graduating class Valedictorian. Very impressive, indeed, but is that the right person to be President of the United States?"
2969,I think It is OK to talk about gender. But more importantly I want an authentic candidate.
2970,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman. A wealthy well-connected woman whose husband was president gets elected? Were you impressed when a former mayor's wife who headed the garden club became town treasurer then mayor? American politics is utterly depressing and broken. Clemanceau said that America went from barbarism to decadence without the intervening step of civilization. Warren, please but not that aspiring rapacious empty pantsuit. "
2971,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it. Now that we know that was an extremely hurtful ideology which had a devastating affect on the lives of mainstream women, she'll want to soft-pedal the notion that women should go into the labor force and compete with men for their lives and livelihoods here in America. Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
2972,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
2973,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
2974,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.

That is, she is someone who gets entrenched in the mechanics of government and works her butt off to get all the details right so that all interested parties get some consideration in the final policy.<br/>   The animosity that has been directed towards her, and the off hand insults are largely unwarranted and stem from identity politics more than anything else.  The woman deserves some respect.  She is a very capable deal maker.<br/>   Unfortunately when you broker deals where everyone wins a little and everyone loses a little, nobody goes away happy least of all those furthest from the center.  But this country needs to be governed from the center and Hilary is the only candidate who can actually do that.  "

3043,"The problem of being a woman and a member of the social elite presents some serious tactical problems for Mrs. Clinton. First, she has no life in the mainstream of America, only in her station above it, where she has lived her entire life. Elite lifestyles are not something most folks can relate to. Secondly, she seeks to build a new political life built on yesterday's glory. When Feminism was the calling card of a few of the liberal elite, she embraced it. Now that we know that was an extremely hurtful ideology which had a devastating affect on the lives of mainstream women, she'll want to soft-pedal the notion that women should go into the labor force and compete with men for their lives and livelihoods here in America. Then there is her mindful representation of Israeli interests here and abroad with the result of never-ending conflict in the Middle East. Mindless-endless war in the world. Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
3044,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
3045,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
3046,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.

3109,"Sarah Palin is a woman; but only a minority of women, thankfully, voted for her to become our vice=President because of her gender (and, of course, because of her race). So it is disappointing to see that supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential ambitions argue for her gender as her most important qualification, just as a minority of white women (and some white men) did for Palin's.  The fictional wife Clair Underwood played by Robin Wright in ""House of Cards"" could not be more immoral, calculating and cynical. This is a dangerous time for our country; few things demonstrate the danger more than basing one's vote for Hillary Clinton just because she happen to be a famous white woman with name recognition that, unlike Barak Obama, she obtained from being married to a successful husband."

3111,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.

The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.  And most likely one of the nastiest, roughest-fought elections in decades."
3112,"Hillary reminds me of that smart person in High School who was President of the National Honor Society and graduating class Valedictorian. Very impressive, indeed, but is that the right person to be President of the United States?"
3113,I think It is OK to talk about gender. But more importantly I want an authentic candidate.
3114,"Clinton and Bush? If this happend then we will have at last become a banana republic. Hillary becoming president will have next to no real relevance to the average American woman.

3159,"Even with a Clinton vs. a Bush, the 2016 election could end up as one of the more interesting in our recent history.<br/><br/>There will be Hillary Clinton, the first ever female candidate with a genuine shot at the White house.  Her running mate will most likely be a white or Hispanic male.  The opposition will field a while male with perhaps--for political reasons--a white woman or, if they're willing to excuse one's race,  an Hispanic woman from the party's more distant back benches. <br/><br/>Add to this already interesting mix the presence of Bill Clinton, in perhaps the most important and certainly the most redemptive election of his life.  He, alone, could make this contest highly compelling.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the Republican Party, male-identified and almost totally informed by a base that's dominated by perpetually aggrieved white, right-wing men, most of whom seemingly detest the Clintons as much as they do President Obama.<br/><br/>The basic ingredients, then, are all in place for a real eye-opener.

Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely. The ever widening gap between the social elite and the rest of America is widening. Now, can an aging member of the social elite, indebted to other members of the social elite do anything for say, the other half of humanity (men) ? Still unlikely. Fresh thinking from Hillary ? No way."
3164,"Being a woman or a grandmother is in no way shape or form a qualification to be president. While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
3165,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."
3166,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.
3167,"The same people are so excited about having the first woman president would be having the exact opposite reaction if Hillary Clinton were a Republican, married to a former Republican president. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the first woman president. It has everything to do with Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee because the Democrats have a weak bench."
3168,"Do we really want to elect someone who is a woman because she's a woman?  <br/><br/>How does Hillary make the argument work?  That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.  If we elect a woman for being a woman, we're basically saying that we chose the wrong genetic basis for leading the country all these years."

Women do not usually kill, so will Mrs.Clinton say ""enough is enough!"" Not likely. She has her constituency she is beholden to and that is a truth of American politics. As far as America knows, the Clinton Administration never killed anybody. What about a Mrs. Clinton Administration ? Again, not likely.

While we have only elected men to the office we haven't elected them because they were men, fathers, or grandfathers. Some past presidents have had outstanding qualifications, some have had weaker qualifications but they didn't tout their XY chromosomes."
3213,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."

3216,"Do we really want to elect someone who is a woman because she's a woman?  <br/><br/>How does Hillary make the argument work?  That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.

3285,"As a life long Democrat, mother and grandmother who worked most of her life, I am not swooning over Mrs. Clinton nor do I feel I should.  We are now obsessed in this country over candidates whom we think it is time for.  We have never had a woman so let's elect one.  I fear we don't look at the content of their character any more but the excitement that something new and different will bring.  When I look at the shameless fund raising done by the Clinton Foundation with the ridiculous amounts received from foreign governments and the exorbitant speech fees commanded by both Clintons I wonder how my fellow Democrats equate this with interest in the struggling middle class.  Maybe it's time for an inspirational competent leader who can see us through the complexities of the world we now live in without regard to ethnicity or gender."

That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.

3331,Hillary will win in 2016 despite the efforts of fringe element haters because she has a reasoned temperament and that is what American voters like to see.
3332,"Happy to hear that Hilary's handlers have settled on initial packaging choices for her brand reintroduction. Now they can get down to coining some slogans and testing the preliminary marketing campaign on focus groups. As soon as the qualitative research is in, they can decide on facings and start moving product."
3333,"Hillary would be wise not to run from her gender.  After all, she is female and there are an awful lot of women who think it's more than time for a female President.  <br/><br/>Female heads of state no longer make news.  Thatcher, Merkel, even Meir were, and are, very tough leaders.  An increasing number of females have risen to the top job.  So why not America, and why not now?<br/><br/>There are many other advantages to highlighting, not hiding from, gender.  So many of the issues that will hopefully be front and center of the Democratic agenda are female-focused: equal pay and opportunity, protection of reproductive rights, preschool education, family-focused tax reform--in fact, family issues and economics in general.  <br/><br/>As for the old stereotypical ""women are weak"" argument, I'd argue that that itself is a relic of the last century.  Or the Republican party.  In fact, voters will be given a real choice if Hillary does run.  They can choose a party that feels women aren't able to make their own choices ...or a party that sees women as strong and competent, with or without a man.    "
3334,Sounds like a solid strategy. I'm looking forward to watching the campaign season. It's strange how only in America would a candidate have to painstakingly choreograph how to refer to their basic demographic characteristics.
3335,"The same people are so excited about having the first woman president would be having the exact opposite reaction if Hillary Clinton were a Republican, married to a former Republican president. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with the first woman president. It has everything to do with Hillary Clinton's coronation as the Democratic nominee because the Democrats have a weak bench."
3336,"Do we really want to elect someone who is a woman because she's a woman?  <br/><br/>How does Hillary make the argument work?  That a woman should be president because women are every bit as good as men, or that a woman should be president because of the unique attributes a female brings to the job?<br/><br/>I'd say she can't have it both ways.  But then, it's Hillary.  Logic doesn't matter.  It's just about power and she'll do and say anything (like a man?) to get it.<br/><br/>For me, I think electing a black man president because he's black is less distasteful than electing a woman president because she's a woman.  Black is only skin deep.  Women and men, however, are genetically distinct in ways having phylogenetic consequences.  That's what having two X chromosomes means.  If we elect a woman for being a woman, we're basically saying that we chose the wrong genetic basis for leading the country all these years."

3341,"This assumes she's be the nominee a year and a half before the election.  A little  presumptive, a little too self-entitled.  It reminds me of 7 years ago when she and all the people around her thought she couldn't miss."
3342,"Pakistan had a female leader but not the US - yet.  It's past time. But electing a woman president isn't at the top of my list. I distrust Clinton for her corporatism at a time when we need Big Money out of politics and economic reform that would include a big reduction in Corporate Welfare, more room for small business to grow and compete, and tax reform to eliminate differential treatment of investment income and wages, just for a start. Clinton will, at best, slow down the destruction of the last vestiges of the New Deal. As Secretary of State she didn't make a difference.<br/><br/>Not good enough."
3343,"She finally realizes the only thing that could possibly differentiate her from the rest of the mass of craven politicians angling for the top spot: a dress! <br/><br/>For everyone pushing for a Hillary run because 'it would be exciting to have a female President' I can only say that politics should not be about making yourself feel better by proxy, it's about real issues that will effect this and future generations!!

3344,"Margaret Thatcher, Angela Merkel, Golda Meir and others did it on their own. Not only were they not married to former presidents, they were married to men who provided them no access to any position in government.<br/><br/>Hillary Clinton, who would likely not have been elected to anything had she not married Bill Clinton, is not the woman who should break the ultimate American glass ceiling. <br/><br/>Someone like Democrat Elizabeth Warren or Republican Suzanna Martinez?

3398,"Mrs. Clinton, like President Clinton and President Obama, runs to the right of center on most issues. When will the Democrats nominate a Democrat?"
3399,"Obama ran as a candidate for change.

3403,Hillary will win in 2016 despite the efforts of fringe element haters because she has a reasoned temperament and that is what American voters like to see.
3404,"Happy to hear that Hilary's handlers have settled on initial packaging choices for her brand reintroduction.

3405,"Hillary would be wise not to run from her gender.  After all, she is female and there are an awful lot of women who think it's more than time for a female President.  <br/><br/>Female heads of state no longer make news.  Thatcher, Merkel, even Meir were, and are, very tough leaders.  An increasing number of females have risen to the top job.  So why not America, and why not now?<br/><br/>There are many other advantages to highlighting, not hiding from, gender.  So many of the issues that will hopefully be front and center of the Democratic agenda are female-focused: equal pay and opportunity, protection of reproductive rights, preschool education, family-focused tax reform--in fact, family issues and economics in general.  <br/><br/>As for the old stereotypical ""women are weak"" argument, I'd argue that that itself is a relic of the last century.  Or the Republican party.  In fact, voters will be given a real choice if Hillary does run.

3407,"With the possible exception of Jeb Bush delivering Florida and the Democrats losing Pennsylvania, the election is already over and it actually doesn’t matter who the Democrats run – they will win, winning the same states Obama won in the last election.   Obama had 257 electoral votes without VA, CO, IA, OH or FL.   Either VA, OH, FL or the combo of CO and IA delivers the election to the Dems again.     <br/><br/>And if the Republicans don’t run Jeb Bush, they will run some ultra-conservative crazy who will do very well in Republican primaries, but will fail miserably in the national election, especially in the electoral vote.   <br/><br/>Republicans are not going to win the White House until they either ignore their own primaries or get rid of them completely.

3506,"If Hillary were serious about representing the populist wing of her party, she would get a divorce from wall street, and other corporate entitiies and commit to appointing people like Sheila Bair, Robert Reich, the current U.S Attorney for Manhatten and the Eastern district of New York, to be the next Treasury Secretary, Fed Chairman, and attorney general respectively.

3722,"If Hillary were serious about representing the populist wing of her party, she would get a divorce from wall street, and other corporate entitiies and commit to appointing people like Sheila Bair, Robert Reich, the current U.S Attorney for Manhatten and the Eastern district of New York, to be the next Treasury Secretary, Fed Chairman, and attorney general respectively.

Ask yourself, if this pipeline was needed for OUR energy needs why pipe it all the way to Texas so it can be exported overseas? Why not refine it in Canada? The Koch dudes own 25% of the pipeline.<br/>

4012,"Tar sands will go down in history (if we survive to have a history) as one of western hubris's greatest mistakes.  Piping it from Canada to Texas is bafflingly stupid on so many levels.<br/><br/>Please note the recent developments in Alberta as well:<br/>
""In the past week, a drought and strong winds have combined to produce huge wildfires that gutted much of the town of Slave Lake—all 7,000 residents had to evacuate, and the city hall and many other buildings were burned to the ground. Right now there are over a hundred wild fires raging in Alberta, with 36 of them still ‘out of control.’<br/><br/>""Just two weeks before the fires, a massive spill from an oil pipeline sickened residents of the community of Little Buffalo, the traditional lands of the Lubicon Cree. It took the government six days to show up and begin monitoring the air, despite the fact that  local residents were suffering headaches, burning and nausea from the stench.  ....<br/><br/>""The reason the government doesn’t want to acknowledge the problem, of course, is that this region of Alberta is home to the giant tar sands project. Over the objections of many indigenous residents residents, they’ve made a moonscape of large swaths of the region, as they ramp up massive oil production. When that oil leaks, it’s bad—and it’s bad when it’s burnt too, because it pours carbon into the atmosphere. The carbon that raises the temperature, making wildfire and drought more likely and more devastating.""<br/><br/>But, gasp, weather is not climate.  I've got news for you all, all weather is part of climate.  Climate is just weather over space and time, the time measured in (at least) decades and space including the upper atmosphere.  It also includes some patterns and developments that are not observable in the short term, but are clearer when overall phenomena are measured.<br/><br/>In fact, global warming has increased the energy in the system, and there is also more water vapor.  The boiling we are experiencing in our weather titbits are characteristic of the developing prevalence of extreme weather, and the sorting of extreme weather into dry and flooded areas, with battles in between, is just the beginning.  Those who say this is characteristic<br/><br/>And in this context, people not only want to create additional vulnerabilities with vast delivery systems, but increase the effects due to these causes?

4014,"Re: Technic Ally... um, I'm usually the first to jump on ""corrupt political system"", but what about this article has proven ANY corruption?  All you have is a guy who worked on Clinton's campaign (which, by the by, hundreds of people did - and dozens did in the upper echelons) who is now a lobbyist in a legally and ethically permissible position, lobbying the United States Government - specifically the Department of State - for permission to do something that the US Gov't has already indicated it wants done.  And an environmental group wants Clinton's emails, via FOIA, to ensure there's no foul play - rightly so, I might add.  But they don't have Clinton's emails, and they haven't put forth any basis for believing there is corruption other than the tenuous political connection between Elliott and Clinton.<br/><br/>Why don't we acknowledge what this blog spot really is: a story about how some activists are suing to find out if there really is a story.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Let's put our knee-jerk reactions back in the box for a minute and simmer down, why don't we, until we get to look at the emails."

Other IRS categories exist for organizations that are not tax exempt and can spend on political or any other activity."
4049,"It's unfortunate the Ms Lerner did not just enforce the law as writen.  The actual law (not the administrative procedures as implemented under Eisenhower) states the for the 501c4 category of non profit funds may be used ""exclusively"" for social welfare.  Not most, or some, or 50.01% but ""all"".  No political spending at all.  None. Zero.  Nada.  <br/><br/>All she needed to do was send a letter to all 501c4 outfits reminding them of the law and asserting that the IRS was reverting to the law and all permitted organizations had to ensure that all funds were spent on social welfare.  No political spending would be allowed going forward.  <br/><br/> Oh, she could have also identified the IRS categories that would be options if they wished to engage in political spending.

4050,"Tried to research the IRS issue involving Cindy Thomas, former Cincinnati IRS official, whose name surfaces as having issued a denial that targeting conservative groups originated with low-level employees in her office, with the denial used to imply that target-orders were issued higher up. All I could find as evidence was an email fragment so distorted in Fox and other media claims as to be beyond silly. Actually, Ms. Thomas merely objected to the term ""low-level employees"" used by Ms. Lerner because it could lower employees' credibility with the public they serve. Read the benign and falsely misunderstood quote in conservatives' own Juduicial Watch, Weekly Update: Major IRS Scandal News, APRIL 18, 2014: [Quote] ""May 10, 2013: An email from former Cincinnati program manager Cindy Thomas excoriates Lerner for her comments blaming “low-level” employees in its Cincinnati office for targeting tax-exempt organizations that had “Tea Party” or “Patriots” in their names during the 2012 election. Highlighting the words “low-level workers” in bold-face type each of the seven times she used it in short, pungent email, Thomas asked, “How am I supposed to keep the low-level workers motivated when the public believes they are nothing more than low-level workers and now will have no respect for how they are working cases?” Lerner’s response nearly an hour later was a terse, “I will be back shortly and give you a call.” [End Quote]<br/>There's no there there."

IRS and Benghazi are much ado about nothing when placed against the criminality of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and the fake WMD that took us into a war that killed 4000 of our military and wounded 40,000 of them and also brought the US into the realm of the countries that torture.    "
4052,"Basically what I've learned since the last election is: All you have to do is say it. It doesn't matter if it's true. If you want to manipulate the discussion, just say anything that you need in order to change it, the press will back you up. When the lies are exposed no one will be paying attention. People who are not paying attention will believe whatever you say, and that means a large majority. "
4053,"I wish that whenever an article about the 501(c)(4) operations of the Cincinnati IRS office is published, the factoid that organizations with politically overtly left wing and politically overtly right wing names were ""targeted"" in more or less the same way would be repeated.  Not doing so allows the mistaken notion that only ""conservative"" organizations were ""targeted"".<br/>More generally, I wish Congress would get rid of this problem for the future by repealing IRS Code Section 501(c)(4).  This is less likely."
4054,"Same old republican/tea party playbook they have been doing since Clinton's impeachment- and probably before as well. Let's find some distraction/wedge issue to get the rabid right base all foamed up at the mouth- like this, bengazi, etc etc.. so we can use it as a distraction and not bother to get anything done to move the country forward.

The refusal is based upon the claim of executive privilege, and I generally think that's a good call, for either party.<br/><br/>But has a government employee ever before refused to testify about official job performance based on the Fifth Amendment?  I don't think so, I believe that the Lerner refusal is unprecedented. Sure, lots of mobsters and such have invoked the Fifth, and that's fine, that's what it's there for.  But has any other government employee in history claimed the Fifth Amendment before Congress, when asked about official conduct? I don't know of any, and I'd love to know if any commenters know of any."
4057,Government by lunacy - this can't end well.
4058,"I don't understand the lack of outrage here.  Are liberals so tought to hate anyone that doesn't agree with them on everything that they cannot objectively be outraged by the actions of the IRS?!  While I'm not a conservative and am discusted by some of the actions of the house, I'm equally discusted by the Senate and many of the Dems when it comes to this topic.  Not to mention the lack of media coverage. <br/><br/> Whether we like or don't like the tea party people or movement, it is unconscionable for the IRS to favor ANY applicant for ANY reason.  If they are not accountable for upholding the laws and regulations, who is?  I'm not a fan of the broad approval for non-profits, but many that were approved were obviously liberal and political.  They should have been turned down.<br/><br/>If all the applications for tax exempt status were held up, or rejected, or if even most were treated in the same way, I would agree that the Reps are looking for political fodder.  But that is not the case, and readers here that have 'forgotten' that fact are disingenuous.  Everyone here is always reacting to statistics and data - even changes in a percentage point - as pointing to a problem, racism, unfairness, etc..  But when it comes to the overwhelming facts that the IRS targeted conservative groups, not only holding up and denying approval, but requiring personal information and then giving it to another private organization during an election year, we must all be outraged.  Tomorrow it is you."
4059,I truly hope the Obama administration does not wimp out in supporting Ms. Lerner the way they have other times the Republicons have attacked their officials and appointments.
4060,"I just love the ""both sides do it"" of Mr. Peters and his article.  I am sure he and his  editors believe this is what is necessary to keep their Republican sources.   Ms. Lerner, a civil servant in the IRS with no political role is just like Harriet Myers and Joshua Bolten in the U.S. Attorney scandal, both political appointees acting as political appointees.  The only scandal is that these partisan Tea Party groups get tax free status.   Which means the rest of us have to pay higher taxes to pay for the wars the Republicans love so much (but don't send their children to fight)."
4061,"Democrats are now calling this move by the Republicans to hold Lois Lerner in contempt (with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections, no doubt) a McCarthy-type ""witch hunt"".  <br/><br/>I do believe that Sigmund Freud (rest his soul) would LOL if he heard this!  Psychological projection...the thought process of defending oneself against unpleasant impulses by denying their existence in oneself, while attributing them to others.  For example, a person who secretly harbors bigoted or racist feelings will usually be the first one to accuse others of RACISM.  We see and hear it in the news each and every day! <br/><br/>I'm curious...what would the current defenders and apologists for Lois Lerner (who are now calling this a ""witch hunt"") say about Chris Christie and ""Bridge-Gate""??<br/><br/>Having said that, without hypocrisy and lying as accepted practices, there would be absolutely no need for politics and politicians. "
4062,"This expose is just the tip of the iceberg for Republicans.  Wait until they reveal that women have wrongfully been granted the right to vote and hold impeachment hearings on Bella Absug, Gloria Stienham, and Bobby Riggs. (Pardon my spelling its been such a long time). Brace your self for enlightenment folks!!!"
4063,"What is wrong with most of you posters? The fact that Republicans are doing the probing shows that the government is functioning as conceived. If a Republican were abusing the functioning of the IRS, I would hope Democrats would be in pursuit. The New York Times would screaming to high heaven for something to be done."
4064,"To paraphrase John Boehner's “When is the administration going to tell the American people the truth? They’ve not told the truth about Benghazi, they’ve not told the truth about the I.R.S,” we should ask: ""When is the Republican conspiracy machine going to provide evidence of any crime?  They have no evidence about Benghazi, they've not given convincing evidence about the I.R.S. Or the administration committing a crime.""<br/><br/>At best they have claimed there was incompetence or bureaucrats hiding their mistakes, but that has happened in every administration since our nation was founded and was far worse in previous Republican administrations with no peep from these sameRepublicans.<br/><br/>The real scandal here is how Republicans elected by a minority are using the power of government to their own ends to increase their own political power, not in the interests of our nation.  They have no shame.<br/><br/>It is clear that ""Benghazi"" is Republican for ""SQUIRREL"" to be used to distract their voters.  It works on my dogs, but God help us if it works on the electorate."
4065,"Representative Jackie Speier of California. “Psychologists will tell you that when somebody says something is not, it clearly is.”... So Mr. Speier, if I point to a tree and tell you it is a maple tree, psychologists will tell you it is not a maple tree even though it was a red maple?<br/><br/>More interesting “They have to rough her up,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. “If Hillary announced definitively tomorrow that she had no interest in running for president, I think Benghazi would disappear.”<br/><br/>Proof our elected officials and in some ways our media are no longer about finding the truth but praying things ""disappear""... If the truth was told, why would it need to ""disappear"" in the first place?"
4066,"If contempt of Congress is a crime, then the entire nation should be cited.  Thank you GOP/Tea Party - mission accomplished!"
4067,"So the obsessive GOP focus on (utter NON-issues like) the alleged IRS persecution of the right-wing and the Bengazi affair 2 years later ""signals [an] element of G.O.P. election strategy""?  Really?<br/><br/>Haven't they been ""signaling"" this for the last 10 years in pretty much all they do?  <br/><br/>In lieu of ANY PRETENSE of addressing real pressing issues -- like unemployment, the economy, healthcare, the environment, the ever-increasing rift between rich and the rest of us -- the GOB's strategy is to obstruct, obscure, and prevent anything positive from happening in Washington, whatever the costs!  <br/><br/>All in hopes that they'll be rewarded for their relentless negativity and gridlock by an increasingly disgusted electorate."
4068,"Well, since the Republican House can't seem to do anything else, at least this makes them seem a little self important. What a joke!"
4069,Rote partisanship is on full display in the House and on the NYT comment boards. Both are equally intellectually lazy. <br/><br/>When politics is reduced to an obtuse cynical tribalism we all lose.
4070,"Wave it off dismissively all you want now...<br/><br/>But guaranteed --<br/><br/>The republicans will use Benghazi in a relentless, non-stop assault against Hillary Clinton, should she choose to run for president -<br/><br/>They will pound her with this like a butcher's mallet used to flatten cuts of meat...<br/><br/>They will blame the deaths at Benghazi on Clinton - accusing her of incompetency and the orchestration of a cover-up...<br/><br/>Frankly - the best thing that could possibly happen would be for the truth about Benghazi to be completely and totally revealed *before* we enter the the next presidential election period --"

4083,I truly hope the Obama administration does not wimp out in supporting Ms. Lerner the way they have other times the Republicons have attacked their officials and appointments.
4084,"I just love the ""both sides do it"" of Mr. Peters and his article.  I am sure he and his  editors believe this is what is necessary to keep their Republican sources.   Ms. Lerner, a civil servant in the IRS with no political role is just like Harriet Myers and Joshua Bolten in the U.S. Attorney scandal, both political appointees acting as political appointees.  The only scandal is that these partisan Tea Party groups get tax free status.   Which means the rest of us have to pay higher taxes to pay for the wars the Republicans love so much (but don't send their children to fight)."

They have no evidence about Benghazi, they've not given convincing evidence about the I.R.S. Or the administration committing a crime.""<br/><br/>At best they have claimed there was incompetence or bureaucrats hiding their mistakes, but that has happened in every administration since our nation was founded and was far worse in previous Republican administrations with no peep from these sameRepublicans.<br/><br/>The real scandal here is how Republicans elected by a minority are using the power of government to their own ends to increase their own political power, not in the interests of our nation.

They are true American heroes this day; let us all applaud their courageous moral stands."
4096,"Remember, the actual law states that money collected is to be used, ""exclusively for social welfare.."".  Exclusively means 100%, only, solely - that any political spending occured is because an IRS Commissioner under Eisenhower decided that ""exclusively"" meant ""mostly"" which translated into 51% with the remaining 49% available for political.<br/><br/>No organizations under 501c4 and tax exempt should spend a penny on political activity.  Other IRS categories exist for organizations that are not tax exempt and can spend on political or any other activity."
4097,"It's unfortunate the Ms Lerner did not just enforce the law as writen.  The actual law (not the administrative procedures as implemented under Eisenhower) states the for the 501c4 category of non profit funds may be used ""exclusively"" for social welfare.  Not most, or some, or 50.01% but ""all"".  No political spending at all.  None. Zero.  Nada.  <br/><br/>All she needed to do was send a letter to all 501c4 outfits reminding them of the law and asserting that the IRS was reverting to the law and all permitted organizations had to ensure that all funds were spent on social welfare.

Maybe helped them with paper work to transition."
4098,"Tried to research the IRS issue involving Cindy Thomas, former Cincinnati IRS official, whose name surfaces as having issued a denial that targeting conservative groups originated with low-level employees in her office, with the denial used to imply that target-orders were issued higher up. All I could find as evidence was an email fragment so distorted in Fox and other media claims as to be beyond silly. Actually, Ms. Thomas merely objected to the term ""low-level employees"" used by Ms. Lerner because it could lower employees' credibility with the public they serve. Read the benign and falsely misunderstood quote in conservatives' own Juduicial Watch, Weekly Update: Major IRS Scandal News, APRIL 18, 2014: [Quote] ""May 10, 2013: An email from former Cincinnati program manager Cindy Thomas excoriates Lerner for her comments blaming “low-level” employees in its Cincinnati office for targeting tax-exempt organizations that had “Tea Party” or “Patriots” in their names during the 2012 election. Highlighting the words “low-level workers” in bold-face type each of the seven times she used it in short, pungent email, Thomas asked, “How am I supposed to keep the low-level workers motivated when the public believes they are nothing more than low-level workers and now will have no respect for how they are working cases?” Lerner’s response nearly an hour later was a terse, “I will be back shortly and give you a call.” [End Quote]<br/>There's no there there."

4146,"Tried to research the IRS issue involving Cindy Thomas, former Cincinnati IRS official, whose name surfaces as having issued a denial that targeting conservative groups originated with low-level employees in her office, with the denial used to imply that target-orders were issued higher up. All I could find as evidence was an email fragment so distorted in Fox and other media claims as to be beyond silly. Actually, Ms. Thomas merely objected to the term ""low-level employees"" used by Ms. Lerner because it could lower employees' credibility with the public they serve. Read the benign and falsely misunderstood quote in conservatives' own Juduicial Watch, Weekly Update: Major IRS Scandal News, APRIL 18, 2014: [Quote] ""May 10, 2013: An email from former Cincinnati program manager Cindy Thomas excoriates Lerner for her comments blaming “low-level” employees in its Cincinnati office for targeting tax-exempt organizations that had “Tea Party” or “Patriots” in their names during the 2012 election. Highlighting the words “low-level workers” in bold-face type each of the seven times she used it in short, pungent email, Thomas asked, “How am I supposed to keep the low-level workers motivated when the public believes they are nothing more than low-level workers and now will have no respect for how they are working cases?” Lerner’s response nearly an hour later was a terse, “I will be back shortly and give you a call.” [End Quote]<br/>There's no there there."
4147,"""stool""<br/>The use of that word in reference to the Republicans is totally appropriate.  But the kind of ""stool"" they are and the kind of ""stool on which their campaign strategy will rest"" -- doesn't have legs but it does have a very unpleasant stench.  IRS and Benghazi are much ado about nothing when placed against the criminality of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and the fake WMD that took us into a war that killed 4000 of our military and wounded 40,000 of them and also brought the US into the realm of the countries that torture.

The refusal is based upon the claim of executive privilege, and I generally think that's a good call, for either party.<br/><br/>But has a government employee ever before refused to testify about official job performance based on the Fifth Amendment?  I don't think so, I believe that the Lerner refusal is unprecedented. Sure, lots of mobsters and such have invoked the Fifth, and that's fine, that's what it's there for.  But has any other government employee in history claimed the Fifth Amendment before Congress, when asked about official conduct?

Not to mention the lack of media coverage. <br/><br/> Whether we like or don't like the tea party people or movement, it is unconscionable for the IRS to favor ANY applicant for ANY reason.  If they are not accountable for upholding the laws and regulations, who is?  I'm not a fan of the broad approval for non-profits, but many that were approved were obviously liberal and political.  They should have been turned down.<br/><br/>If all the applications for tax exempt status were held up, or rejected, or if even most were treated in the same way, I would agree that the Reps are looking for political fodder.  But that is not the case, and readers here that have 'forgotten' that fact are disingenuous.  Everyone here is always reacting to statistics and data - even changes in a percentage point - as pointing to a problem, racism, unfairness, etc..  But when it comes to the overwhelming facts that the IRS targeted conservative groups, not only holding up and denying approval, but requiring personal information and then giving it to another private organization during an election year, we must all be outraged.  Tomorrow it is you."

4156,"I just love the ""both sides do it"" of Mr. Peters and his article.  I am sure he and his  editors believe this is what is necessary to keep their Republican sources.   Ms. Lerner, a civil servant in the IRS with no political role is just like Harriet Myers and Joshua Bolten in the U.S. Attorney scandal, both political appointees acting as political appointees.  The only scandal is that these partisan Tea Party groups get tax free status.

If you want to manipulate the discussion, just say anything that you need in order to change it, the press will back you up. When the lies are exposed no one will be paying attention. People who are not paying attention will believe whatever you say, and that means a large majority. "
4197,"I wish that whenever an article about the 501(c)(4) operations of the Cincinnati IRS office is published, the factoid that organizations with politically overtly left wing and politically overtly right wing names were ""targeted"" in more or less the same way would be repeated.  Not doing so allows the mistaken notion that only ""conservative"" organizations were ""targeted"".<br/>More generally, I wish Congress would get rid of this problem for the future by repealing IRS Code Section 501(c)(4).  This is less likely."
4198,"Same old republican/tea party playbook they have been doing since Clinton's impeachment- and probably before as well. Let's find some distraction/wedge issue to get the rabid right base all foamed up at the mouth- like this, bengazi, etc etc.. so we can use it as a distraction and not bother to get anything done to move the country forward. Of course, much easier to witch hunt than to solve major problems like global warming, crmbling infrastructure- and a hundred other problems we need action on.... yes, with leadership like this- who needs foreign enemies?"
4199,"In the meantime, the Dems are doubling down on climate change so they can use it in the upcoming elections. Climate change deniers are stupid and raciest and evil! How elegantly simple. There almost as bad as Republicans."
4200,"NYTimes commenters, help me out here.  I know that the refusal of executive branch officials to testify before Congress is routine in both Republican and Democratic administrations.  The refusal is based upon the claim of executive privilege, and I generally think that's a good call, for either party.<br/><br/>But has a government employee ever before refused to testify about official job performance based on the Fifth Amendment?  I don't think so, I believe that the Lerner refusal is unprecedented. Sure, lots of mobsters and such have invoked the Fifth, and that's fine, that's what it's there for.  But has any other government employee in history claimed the Fifth Amendment before Congress, when asked about official conduct? I don't know of any, and I'd love to know if any commenters know of any."
4201,Government by lunacy - this can't end well.
4202,"I don't understand the lack of outrage here.  Are liberals so tought to hate anyone that doesn't agree with them on everything that they cannot objectively be outraged by the actions of the IRS?!

Not to mention the lack of media coverage. <br/><br/> Whether we like or don't like the tea party people or movement, it is unconscionable for the IRS to favor ANY applicant for ANY reason.

They should have been turned down.<br/><br/>If all the applications for tax exempt status were held up, or rejected, or if even most were treated in the same way, I would agree that the Reps are looking for political fodder.  But that is not the case, and readers here that have 'forgotten' that fact are disingenuous.  Everyone here is always reacting to statistics and data - even changes in a percentage point - as pointing to a problem, racism, unfairness, etc..  But when it comes to the overwhelming facts that the IRS targeted conservative groups, not only holding up and denying approval, but requiring personal information and then giving it to another private organization during an election year, we must all be outraged.

4203,I truly hope the Obama administration does not wimp out in supporting Ms. Lerner the way they have other times the Republicons have attacked their officials and appointments.
4204,"I just love the ""both sides do it"" of Mr. Peters and his article.  I am sure he and his  editors believe this is what is necessary to keep their Republican sources.   Ms. Lerner, a civil servant in the IRS with no political role is just like Harriet Myers and Joshua Bolten in the U.S. Attorney scandal, both political appointees acting as political appointees.  The only scandal is that these partisan Tea Party groups get tax free status.   Which means the rest of us have to pay higher taxes to pay for the wars the Republicans love so much (but don't send their children to fight)."
4205,"Democrats are now calling this move by the Republicans to hold Lois Lerner in contempt (with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections, no doubt) a McCarthy-type ""witch hunt"".  <br/><br/>I do believe that Sigmund Freud (rest his soul) would LOL if he heard this!

For example, a person who secretly harbors bigoted or racist feelings will usually be the first one to accuse others of RACISM.  We see and hear it in the news each and every day! <br/><br/>I'm curious...what would the current defenders and apologists for Lois Lerner (who are now calling this a ""witch hunt"") say about Chris Christie and ""Bridge-Gate""??<br/><br/>Having said that, without hypocrisy and lying as accepted practices, there would be absolutely no need for politics and politicians.

4208,"To paraphrase John Boehner's “When is the administration going to tell the American people the truth? They’ve not told the truth about Benghazi, they’ve not told the truth about the I.R.S,” we should ask: ""When is the Republican conspiracy machine going to provide evidence of any crime?  They have no evidence about Benghazi, they've not given convincing evidence about the I.R.S. Or the administration committing a crime.""<br/><br/>At best they have claimed there was incompetence or bureaucrats hiding their mistakes, but that has happened in every administration since our nation was founded and was far worse in previous Republican administrations with no peep from these sameRepublicans.<br/><br/>The real scandal here is how Republicans elected by a minority are using the power of government to their own ends to increase their own political power, not in the interests of our nation.  They have no shame.<br/><br/>It is clear that ""Benghazi"" is Republican for ""SQUIRREL"" to be used to distract their voters.  It works on my dogs, but God help us if it works on the electorate."
4209,"Representative Jackie Speier of California. “Psychologists will tell you that when somebody says something is not, it clearly is.”...

If the truth was told, why would it need to ""disappear"" in the first place?"
4210,"If contempt of Congress is a crime, then the entire nation should be cited.  Thank you GOP/Tea Party - mission accomplished!"

4212,"Well, since the Republican House can't seem to do anything else, at least this makes them seem a little self important. What a joke!"
4213,Rote partisanship is on full display in the House and on the NYT comment boards. Both are equally intellectually lazy. <br/><br/>When politics is reduced to an obtuse cynical tribalism we all lose.
4214,"Wave it off dismissively all you want now...<br/><br/>But guaranteed --<br/><br/>The republicans will use Benghazi in a relentless, non-stop assault against Hillary Clinton, should she choose to run for president -<br/><br/>They will pound her with this like a butcher's mallet used to flatten cuts of meat...<br/><br/>They will blame the deaths at Benghazi on Clinton - accusing her of incompetency and the orchestration of a cover-up...<br/><br/>Frankly - the best thing that could possibly happen would be for the truth about Benghazi to be completely and totally revealed *before* we enter the the next presidential election period --"
4215,"What was Obama's most famous quote?

They are true American heroes this day; let us all applaud their courageous moral stands."
4216,"We have not seen yet more than the 'tip of the iceberg' in the amount of corrupt practice being committed.   If it is not corrupt practice what do you call it when federal bureaucracies play to the tune of a 'commanding general'?<br/><br/>And, it is NOT SO that such an extent of this kind of thing ever happened before in the national seat of power.   AND isn't it also a new thing in Washington when most all the media form a line of defense around the political forces in power?   This also never had happened to such an extent in American history.  <br/><br/>There is then a very good case that the last presidential election was in fact a stolen election.<br/>And if it weren't for the fact the Republicans also try to cater to an utterly misinformed citizenry, where they are led by the nose like herded pigs with rings in their noses,  just because that's the sorry state of affairs to which politics and with it government operations have sunk, then they already would have started the impeachment proceedings. <br/><br/>When the population has been reduced to a herd of swine-like people feeding at the government trough, what else can we expect than circuses been held in Congress to make a 'good show' to entertain a populace that will assuredly soon jump into the sea like lemmings,<br/>... if there isn't anything else to save them."
4217,"So long as mainstream media continue to present the Republican follies as legitimate political actions, the integrity of our political process will continue to slide downhill.

4218,"A Republican House that refused to address urgent issues by instead doing silly things such as voting to repeal Obamacare over 40 times would seem to be sailing into treacherous seas by offering voters -- as proof that they did accomplish some things --  the example of the things done by Issa's committee to further break a broken Congress.<br/><br/>The extreme right wing will love it, of course -- but the Republicans already have that group locked and loaded."

4220,"Now that the ACA (aka Obamacare) is clearly working, the Republicans desperate for red meat issues to rally their base with anger, fear and vitriolic venom are dusting off the IRS scandal and Benghazi.  Neither issue has any traction except with a few fanatics and some donors  nor is it clear just what issues need to be resolved after the multitude of hearings and documents over the last two years. As a progressive Democrat, I'm shocked that the IRS authorized so many of these organizations--both Democrat and Republican--whose main purpose was not social welfare, but political warfare.  Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.  Instead, the poisonous polarization that has been the preoccupation of Republicans under Democrat presidents starting with Bill Clinton along with the unlimited toxic money of radical, right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers is on the verge of killing our democracy which requires mutual respect, tolerance of differences and compromise.

Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.

Instead, the poisonous polarization that has been the preoccupation of Republicans under Democrat presidents starting with Bill Clinton along with the unlimited toxic money of radical, right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers is on the verge of killing our democracy which requires mutual respect, tolerance of differences and compromise.

4295,"The purpose of holding a person in contempt, whether in contempt of court or in contempt of Congress, is to pursue further legal process to compel the individual to testify.  In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

4317,Rep. Gowdy (R of FL) is seriously deficient in understanding the world if he believes that  talking points in a violent and volatile situation thousands of miles away can stay exactly the same as understanding and knowledge of that situation evolves. Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras? To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.

A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.

Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.  Instead, the poisonous polarization that has been the preoccupation of Republicans under Democrat presidents starting with Bill Clinton along with the unlimited toxic money of radical, right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers is on the verge of killing our democracy which requires mutual respect, tolerance of differences and compromise.

4365,Rep. Gowdy (R of FL) is seriously deficient in understanding the world if he believes that  talking points in a violent and volatile situation thousands of miles away can stay exactly the same as understanding and knowledge of that situation evolves. Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras? To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

4367,"The purpose of holding a person in contempt, whether in contempt of court or in contempt of Congress, is to pursue further legal process to compel the individual to testify.  In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

4413,Rep.

To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

Psychological projection...the thought process of defending oneself against unpleasant impulses by denying their existence in oneself, while attributing them to others.  For example, a person who secretly harbors bigoted or racist feelings will usually be the first one to accuse others of RACISM.  We see and hear it in the news each and every day! <br/><br/>I'm curious...what would the current defenders and apologists for Lois Lerner (who are now calling this a ""witch hunt"") say about Chris Christie and ""Bridge-Gate""??<br/><br/>Having said that, without hypocrisy and lying as accepted practices, there would be absolutely no need for politics and politicians.

Neither issue has any traction except with a few fanatics and some donors  nor is it clear just what issues need to be resolved after the multitude of hearings and documents over the last two years. As a progressive Democrat, I'm shocked that the IRS authorized so many of these organizations--both Democrat and Republican--whose main purpose was not social welfare, but political warfare.  Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.  Instead, the poisonous polarization that has been the preoccupation of Republicans under Democrat presidents starting with Bill Clinton along with the unlimited toxic money of radical, right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers is on the verge of killing our democracy which requires mutual respect, tolerance of differences and compromise.

As a progressive Democrat, I'm shocked that the IRS authorized so many of these organizations--both Democrat and Republican--whose main purpose was not social welfare, but political warfare.  Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.

4533,Rep. Gowdy (R of FL) is seriously deficient in understanding the world if he believes that  talking points in a violent and volatile situation thousands of miles away can stay exactly the same as understanding and knowledge of that situation evolves. Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras? To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

4535,"The purpose of holding a person in contempt, whether in contempt of court or in contempt of Congress, is to pursue further legal process to compel the individual to testify.  In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

As a progressive Democrat, I'm shocked that the IRS authorized so many of these organizations--both Democrat and Republican--whose main purpose was not social welfare, but political warfare.  Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.

4581,Rep. Gowdy (R of FL) is seriously deficient in understanding the world if he believes that  talking points in a violent and volatile situation thousands of miles away can stay exactly the same as understanding and knowledge of that situation evolves. Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras?

4583,"The purpose of holding a person in contempt, whether in contempt of court or in contempt of Congress, is to pursue further legal process to compel the individual to testify.  In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."
4584,"Ms. Lerner, if I were you, I would frame the contempt citation and display it proudly.  It's an honor to be found contemptible by contemptible characters.  If John Boehner has to announce in advance that his new committee will not be a ""sideshow,"" will not be a ""circus,"" he must believe we require guidance in the matter.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, children...."
4585,The comments seem 100% liberal. Strange.
4586,"“When is the administration going to tell the American people the truth? They’ve not told the truth about Benghazi, they’ve not told the truth about the I.R.S,” he said. “One would have to guess if they’re not willing to tell the American people the truth, it must not be very pretty.”<br/>-------------------------------------<br/>There is no getting around that.

4589,"The Fifth Amendment, which applies to police investigations, was never intended to allow government employees to refuse to explain how they went about doing their jobs.  Ms. Lerner has the right to refuse to answer Congressional questions about her private life, including any crimes that she may have committed as a private citizen.  She does not have the right to flip them the bird over explaining her official conduct as a top IRS employee. This contempt indictment is about 12 months overdue.<br/><br/>My question is, did Republicans delay the contempt move for political purposes?  They should have moved much earlier on this.  Note that the IRS continues to try to apply one standard to the tax-exempt Sierra Club and other liberal organizations, another one to concerned citizens who might oppose Obama. If we can't trust the IRS, and they won't explain their actions, it is time to move to a different approach to generating revenue for the government."
4590,"In an effort to avoid further partisan bickering, I propose the following compromise.  The Democratic controlled New Jersey Assembly will investigate the I.R.S., while the House will investigate the NJ Governor's office.  Win-win."

I so wish the truth be told about the why's and how's of our Supreme Courts' decisions allowing corporations to be considered 'people'. and allowing for unobstructed buying of the government.  I so wish the truth be told about why our soldiers die in Afghanistan while protecting the vast natural resources there that Haliburton is harvesting.  I so wish that oil and gas companies would stop collecting billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies as they pollute and destroy the earth.  Oh wait.

4599,"What was Obama's most famous quote?

A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

Note that the IRS continues to try to apply one standard to the tax-exempt Sierra Club and other liberal organizations, another one to concerned citizens who might oppose Obama.

As a progressive Democrat, I'm shocked that the IRS authorized so many of these organizations--both Democrat and Republican--whose main purpose was not social welfare, but political warfare.  Those exemptions should be eliminated for all parties.  I doubt, however, that this issue will ever come up.  Similarly, a significant aspect of the Benghazi tragedy was the lack of adequate security due to Republicans unwillingness to fund State Department budget because of their obsession with deficit reduction.  Again, there's little doubt that this question, too, will never come up.  Instead, the poisonous polarization that has been the preoccupation of Republicans under Democrat presidents starting with Bill Clinton along with the unlimited toxic money of radical, right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers is on the verge of killing our democracy which requires mutual respect, tolerance of differences and compromise.  So let the show trial, soap opera rerun begin."
4653,Rep.

To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

He rushed to the scene of the attack and dispatched an attacker with the butt of his rifle, or perhaps he didn't , or maybe he was never there.  Scientists are unsure.  The House investigators can watch his 60 Minutes interview, or read his FBI testimony.  The man even wrote a book on the subject!  Or they can watch CBS's retraction and apology for the story, which they said was all just a slight journalistic mistake.  Mr. Davies/Jones has probably come up with some new and more exciting adventures and fun facts about his heroic efforts (or not) that will keep us all on the edges of our seats.

AND isn't it also a new thing in Washington when most all the media form a line of defense around the political forces in power?   This also never had happened to such an extent in American history.  <br/><br/>There is then a very good case that the last presidential election was in fact a stolen election.<br/>And if it weren't for the fact the Republicans also try to cater to an utterly misinformed citizenry, where they are led by the nose like herded pigs with rings in their noses,  just because that's the sorry state of affairs to which politics and with it government operations have sunk, then they already would have started the impeachment proceedings. <br/><br/>When the population has been reduced to a herd of swine-like people feeding at the government trough, what else can we expect than circuses been held in Congress to make a 'good show' to entertain a populace that will assuredly soon jump into the sea like lemmings,<br/>... if there isn't anything else to save them."

4701,Rep.

Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras?

4821,Rep. Gowdy (R of FL) is seriously deficient in understanding the world if he believes that  talking points in a violent and volatile situation thousands of miles away can stay exactly the same as understanding and knowledge of that situation evolves. Does he think some American documentary maker should have anticipated the problem and flown to Libya at just the right time to dodge bullets and record every pertinent action with multiple cameras? To say nothing of that fact that the initial talking points were pretty much on target. Gowdy is only one depressing example. No wonder our Congress is so ineffective.

4823,"The purpose of holding a person in contempt, whether in contempt of court or in contempt of Congress, is to pursue further legal process to compel the individual to testify.  In this situation, the House of Representatives would have to designate counsel to seek a federal court order compelling Ms. Lerner to testify.<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has, however, invoked her 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.  While some have argued that she waived that right by denying that she had done anything illegal, she did not answer any specific questions, testify in detail regarding her version of events, or do anything other than offering a brief blanket denial.  A ruling on waiver would be up to any court asked by Congress to order her to testify,  but the argument that she waived the privilege is very weak, and it is unlikely that a court would compel her to testify on this basis.<br/><br/>The claim has also been made, in other comments here, that while Ms. Lerner might invoke 5th Amendment protection for her conduct as a private individual, she has no right to do so, because  since she is accountable for her performance as a government employee.  Ms. Lerner is, however, no longer a government employee -- she retired from the IRS on September 22, 2013.  <br/><br/>In addition, under Title 18 U.S. Code Sections 6002 and 6005, Congress can only compel her testimony if it grants her immunity from the use of her testimony or evidence derived from it in any criminal case, which Congress has not done."

4970,Contempt of Congress?<br/><br/>Ms. Lerner has plenty of company.
4971,"Instead of solving the real problem with this situation, like reforming the tax code and fully funding the IRS (and other governmental agencies), the GOP wants to grandstand on this rather insignificant situation."

4973,"The Fifth Amendment, which applies to police investigations, was never intended to allow government employees to refuse to explain how they went about doing their jobs.  Ms. Lerner has the right to refuse to answer Congressional questions about her private life, including any crimes that she may have committed as a private citizen.  She does not have the right to flip them the bird over explaining her official conduct as a top IRS employee. This contempt indictment is about 12 months overdue.<br/><br/>My question is, did Republicans delay the contempt move for political purposes?  They should have moved much earlier on this.  Note that the IRS continues to try to apply one standard to the tax-exempt Sierra Club and other liberal organizations, another one to concerned citizens who might oppose Obama. If we can't trust the IRS, and they won't explain their actions, it is time to move to a different approach to generating revenue for the government."

5479,"Well, now that Obamacare appears to be working, the Republicans needed to find another issue ot two to occupy their (and our) time.

It is.  Witch hunters may not like it, but that's what the Fifth Amendmet is for -- to give individual citizens a shield again self-incrimination.   "

5481,"Libyans killed our people in Benghazi, not democrats.<br/><br/>Big duh, huh?<br/><br/>The Republicans consistently play into the hands of foreign terrorists by attacking our people for them."
5482,"The NY Times is proving itself not a source of facts but a source of leftist propaganda. This arrogant woman it is defending – even to the extent of calling the investigation McCarthy like – has invoked the Fifth Amendment several times during the hearings. It’s pretty simple: if she has nothing to hide, why hide it?"
5483,"The fact she has defenders shows how detached from reality Democrats have become. The group think, mob mentality is clear to see."
5484,"Maybe if she would have answered the questions the first time around this wouldn't be happening.  The IRS and the administration have been obstructing this investigation any way they can.  I know it's OK with Dems, but what happens when the shoe is on the other foot?  This is a dangerous precedent."
5485,"Is it too much to hope that the GOP is greatly overplaying their hand?  I mean, come on, the democrats are not angels but the depth of paranoia on the part of the GOP elected officials would be comical if their electorate didn't take them seriously.  I am not sure if this is all simply misguided political strategy on the part of people like Issa, or if they really believe their own hype, and I am not sure which option would actually be worse for the future of the nation.  One can only hope that eventually they get so ridiculous that only a small fringe of their base will continue to believe and support them.  I am not getting my hopes up."

6497,"I may speak only for myself, but I cannot fathom why this honorable woman who held a highly significant post with enormous responsibility in our government would refuse to answer questions from our duly elected representatives who represent the people?  All politics aside for just one minute, I believe that is egregious conduct and makes me suspicious.  "
6498,My understanding is a special prosecutor can pursue any law breaking related to this matter. I wonder how many groups applying for tax exempt status misrepresented the  percentage of their political spending? This might backfire on Republicans.
6499,"There was no wrong doing whatsoever by the IRS here!  Any decent examination of the record by an objective, non partisan auditing source very quickly shows that.  The fault - ironically, ""the contempt"" is all on the side of The extremely partisan and ideologically driven part of the GOP House members that are running this witch hunt.  It's bad enough when these bullies play obstruction games and nothing is done for YEARS in government, it's quite another when they reach out with Congressional power and damage real people with their gamesmanship.<br/><br/>These are elected people who have gone far, far beyond the pale, and broken their oaths of office.  It is they who have broken the law, as it is they who simply deny the record of objective truth, to drive a ""variation of reality"" that is no reality at all.  The IRS has a proper role to investigate political organizations to ensure they are performing their functions as defined by law.  The IRS has always done this, and to organizations on both sides of the spectrum.  It ensures that politically based nonprofits do not break the law.<br/><br/>When will the Media do a hard core shouting from the rafters about this?  There is no wrong doing here, but that the TPGOP wants to make it so.  The US media has let the GOP play it's games, and does feeble false equivalency analysis of their actions against truly reasonable behavior at best.  It's Congress, how bad can it be?  it's Treason!  When will this Congress be called out for what it's doing!"
6500,"It is kind of pathetic when the only thing you can find to campaign on is suggesting that your opponents might, might be lying or covering up.<br/><br/>And, as a general question, how exactly can the alleged existence of a secret conspiracy be disproved?<br/>   As I was walking on the stair<br/>   I met a conspiracy that wasn't there.<br/>   It wasn't there again today.<br/>   Will yelling make it go away?"
6501,"It looks like Republicans can get enough and again are trying to waist the taxpayers monies doing nothing to make common sence legislation,  It would not pass me that behind the scenes fueling these Republicans are the Koch brothers fueling there pet tea party Republicans with money and with an agenda of turmoil and distraction.  As they did when  closing down the government last year, now they are using our Legal system to bog down the legislative process with coverup committees that end up in dead ends and miss use the public funds that tax payers pay.<br/>They can't win the clean way so they have to go as always using dirty political maneuvering."
6502,"It is incredibly obvious that the President and then Secretary of State, as well as many others under their direction, boldly lied and deceived the American public regarding Benghazi. And they are still lying. We don't know why. It makes me think there is a real scandal there. Why goes through all of the lies? Just tell the truth, please.<br/><br/>As for Ms. Lerner, it is absolutely astonishing that as a Federal employee that she had the audacity to refuse to speak to Congress about her actions as an employee. She should have been imediately fired and jailed for such outright contempt of our system. Give her immunity, fine, but strip her of all of her fat lifetime benefits if it turns out that she knowlingly did any real wrong. I am sure she was only following orders, so what does she have to lose? Again, why not come clean?"
6503,None of this is going to change anybody's mind.  I guess they just need to keep their base from nodding off.
6504,Do these people think of anything other than being reelected and getting Obama.  The system-poor to begin with-is now completely broken.  What a shame.
6505,John Boehner ringmaster for the Republican circus.
6506,"Mr Issa. I admire people who are held in contempt of Congress It is we the People who should hold The House of Representatives, the Republicans, and you Daryl for CONTEMPT OF THE PEOPLE. Go back to California and steal a few cars."
6507,"I read this last night, and thought they are really overworking this ""Watergate cover-up"" analogy.  I mean, everything they keep harping on can't rise to the same level of coverup and corruption.<br/><br/>Every special commission, every repeated investigation  costs US taxpayers money.  It's not just corporate fat cats who are funding campaigns.  If useless and senseless hearings about absolutely nothing are the basis for the Republican fall campaign, we citizens are being forced to fund the Republican strategy for 2014.<br/><br/>It's outrageous and it's true corruption to force the US taxpayer to subsidize their calculated, and manipulative hearings so they can get film for their fall congressional campaigns."
6508,GOP decides to waste more of America's time and money in a useless witch hunt.
6509,"Our politicians are more concerned with party dogma and ideology and the power, privilege and trappings of office than doing what is best for my country.  I find this congress in contempt of the public."
6510,"A witch hunt, pure and simple, and the creation of a faux scandal solely for political purposes by extremely corrupt Republican politicians like Darrell Issa who will go to any lengths to destroy the government of the United States while cashing in on governmental largesse. <br/><br/>After all, how dare the IRS try to deny nonprofit, tax-free status to overtly Republican political organizations?  In actual fact, ""Tea Party"" was only one of the keywords used by IRS staffers seeking to identify organizations trying to cheat the system by registering as ""social welfare organizations"", which they clearly are not.<br/><br/>But with Issa and the other corrupt ideologues who run the House of Representatives, facts really don't matter. What matters to them is power, and money, and more power and more money. Simple as that."
6511,unworthy of comment<br/>beneath contempt
6512,"The Republican leadership has no problem holding in contempt and claiming criminal wrongdoing when the alleged actions directly impacts the Republican campaign fund.  However, when the Wall Street Bandits and Speculators nearly brought the world to its knees, they found no wrongdoing and pushed to deregulate more.  Probably because these people fill the Republican campaign fund.  Largest body of hypocrites on the planet.  How we have come to this is beyond any reason, but hopefully people will someday understand the gravity of electing this group of individuals and the negative impact they have had on this great nation."
6513,"At least with the Roman empire, there were ""bread and circuses"" to keep the plebeian contented and docile. However, with the Republicans, all we are getting is more circuses (via Darrell Issa and his likes), and the taking away what little bread there is (cruel cuts to SNAP, and refusal to extend unemployment assistance to the long-term unemployed).<br/><br/>'nough said!"
6514,"Yes this is being used for political points by the Republicans. But at a meeting of the Bar Association, she apologized for the way these groups were targeted by the IRS.

6515,So much for the Fifth Amendment. It seems the Republicans are only interested in the Constitution when it suits their needs.  
6516,"If the House really wanted to do its job, it would eliminate or strictly enforce the blatant, bipartisan political exploitation of 501c3 and 501c4 exemptions that helps all political groups pose as 'non-profit' or 'social welfare' organizations.<br/><br/>The right thing for Congress do is increased IRS funding to do its difficult job.<br/><br/>Instead, the GOP Congress cut the IRS funding in the most recent budget.<br/><br/>The GOP has no ideas; all it has is fear-mongering, paranoia, diversion and an easily manipulated voter base to aid and abet its ongoing sedition of the United States."
6517,Election strategy? The Republicans love to play with people’s lives. When will someone tell them to their face that they are worthless individuals (being polite)?
6518,"The Commissioner of the IRS during this unconscionable persecution of right thinking gringos was.....an appointee of Boy George Bush.<br/>The Inspector General of the IRS, who testified before Congress that no such persecution took place, was an appointee of....Boy George Bush.<br/><br/>But, never fear, Americas' own Inspector Javert, serial car thief, occasional insurance fraud arsonist, Darrell Issa, in riding to the rescue."

Being the most insensitive to the needs of struggling Americans.<br/><br/>By the way, I also have contempt fro the GOP and the Democrats who are nothing more than two sides of the coin.
