These networks dissemble, and plead at how annoying Trump is, or appears, only to go ahead with yet more interviews and analysis because the Donald sells.  Cable News has for many years been more about Entertainment than information for the public.  Trump is a star and they can't get enough of him, whatever disclaimers they so earnestly offer up.  This spotlighting of the frontrunner who in fact is a big fish in a small pond has distorted the political reality: it is extremely early days in a field of way too many people vying for an office that only one may have a shot at, and the voters deserve to see more than one of them, especially when the one on display is so full of himself and so lacking in solutions for the rest of us.

Republicans may say they like him in the polls, but when the dust settles they tend to vote for experience.  I really just don't see Donald Trump winning the nomination.  <br/><br/>I think his rivals would be smart to let him enjoy the spotlight for the time being and use their own down time to hone their message.

So, it would take 203,703 buses to transport the people. A bus charters usually for about $800/day. Allowing an average of 3 days to get to Mexico and 3 days to deadhead back, would cost about $977,774,400.00. Close to a billion dollars when you figure in the driver's room and board along the way. Who's going to pay for this? Mr. Trump? After all, he keeps telling us that he is a rich man. <br/><br/>Or perhaps he would rather fly them. Using 757's with all coach seating would hold about 250 people. That means it would take 44,000 757's to do the job. I have no idea what it costs to rent a 757 to fly to Mexico City and back, but again, Mr. Trump might pay for it as he is, as he assures us, a very rich man. <br/><br/>Or  - - -  hmmm he has his own private 757  - -  maybe - - - - " }
