(This is not confined to any socieconomic class--witness the very common phenomenon of women, and it is only women, in big law firms taking advantage of months of free paid maternity leave, and then not coming back to work at all).  Or, see the guy in Seattle who raised his minimum pay to $70K.  Workers simply do not, except in very rare cases, respond to the employers benefit when they received an unearned benefit.  This, and related concepts like short term horizon, are very difficult for someone who has not run a business to understand.

Thirty million people today have zero health insurance and many more are under-insured. How do we create Universal Health Care for every man, woman and child, and do it in a cost effective way? Other countries do it, the United States of America can do it. The private insurance companies don’t like this idea. We’re going to put them out of business.

That's why POLICY is so central to changing structural racism. <br/><br/>Police quotas, community policing &amp; citizen involvement, school districting, school discipline, bail, civil forfeiture, felon voting rights, affordable housing, for-profit prisons, college funding, etc. These are all areas where change can be made to make ""Black Lives Matter"" in a way that they currently don't.

1790,1790,Obama stated that not all Iranians want to destroy Israel or america and he's right but first they aren't the ones in power thanks to obama who choose to do nothing in 2010 when they tried to overthrow the wild dogs currently in power.<br/>Second the left have been screaming diplomacy for decades and its failed very time and we end up in a military conflict with either a military with its hands tied with rules of engagement written by clueless bureaucrats or worse badly equipped and untrained draftees because they insist on disarming our military while others build.  Peace can only be obtained by strength and I can only imagine how much blood shed could have been avoided by direct action. The other problem I have with obama's deal is his attempt to bypass congress using the U.N a severely corrupt organization that has no business getting involved in ours. Another problem is treaties are dangerous many people died in wwI because of treaties forcing countries to get involved in a ridiculous conflict. Treaties also supersede the constitution a glitch that needs to be fixed which is a big problem when you have two fascists like obama and whoever the Iranian counter part was who hate america conspiring together behind closed doors. ,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/politics/obama-urges-critics-of-iran-deal-to-ignore-drumbeat-of-war.html,-0.100779967159,0,0.431403940887,1

By isolating Cuba from the world community, the USG policies blocked all ideas, commercial ties, political and cultural exchanges which would have shed light into the dark corners of the Castro regime, thus ensuring its stranglehold on Cuban society for the past half-century.<br/><br/>Had the USG not imposed the embargo, Cuba would have become integrated into the global mainstream long, long ago.

What I find maddening on all fronts is the failure to note the fact that all high government officials, including all members of Congress, by logic alone, must receive minute scrutiny by the FBI, CIA and Secret Service, with NSA involvement where deemed to be required to protect national security.  To me the notion that Hillary, who while brilliant, is not a trained computer expert, drifted through the decision without careful review by her team of IT specialists is preposterous.  I am fairly certain that Hillary's IT staff met with FBI, CIA, Secret Service and NSA personnel tasked with guaranteeing her safety and national security.  Had any of the agencies had serious objections to her use of a private server, I'm sure she would have used the government server as requested (if not directed).  The fact is that, at the time she was using a private server, it was the general practice among public officials to do likewise.

Meanwhile, my bigger-picture sense of lack of enthusiasm in the received inevitability of our supposed front-runner has shifted somewhat to alarm. After so many years of overcompensating for the lack of a natural touch with such extensive messaging control and management, Hillary lacks the necessary compass or instincts to connect and communicate.  She and/or or her closest advisers can't seem to stop sabotaging her own candidacy with gratuitously rigid rules over here, cut corners over there, and strained justifications for both.<br/>I personally empathize with a politician who's not a compulsive extrovert and one who's surely been stung plenty over the years by nasty, overly personal attacks when she was merely perhaps being her awkward, imperfect, natural self. Earlier this Summer, my mom whose in her 70s, went to a lunch with some old high school classmates, etc.. One of the guests brought a Hillary Clinton doll simply to ridicule Clinton.

She experienced much of the discrimination of the 20th century and reflected on  the status of women as being a similar challenge affecting not only blacks but all women. Much of that discrimination presented itself in restricted education opportunities; access to jobs, fair wages - equal pay for equal work, and sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace and at home. Ms. Angelou believed that Mrs. Clinton had the best credentials to support women in need - black and white, than Mr. Obama.

Canada's economy has become so tethered to oil over the past 15 years that the recent drop in oil prices has taken Alberta into recession, and possibly the rest of the country too. There's an easy solution here. Amend building codes across North America to require all new buildings - especially single family homes - to have solar panels installed on the roof. The demand for solar will explode, leading to rapid drops in price (making it much more affordable to retrofit  existing buildings) and a massive demand for workers to manufacture and install/maintain. The government could even offer tax incentives for builders who use locally made panels, to maximize job growth. You could create a market overnight. And the best part is, it's not a subsidized market (aside from tax breaks to support local manufacturing), which should make it easier for the Right to support.

2229,2229,"The real issues facing poor people in major US cities is not being addressed by raising the minimum wage to $15. These problems include:<br/><br/>1. A dysfunctional education system which employs a legion of teachers and administrators but which educates relatively few.<br/>2. A dysfunctional housing market.  Restrictive zoning and a laborious construction permitting process means that housing demand outstrips new supply resulting in unaffordable housing for lower income people.<br/>3. Housing discrimination, especially through exclusionary zoning.<br/>4. A dysfunctional mass transit system. For example, New York's mass transit system, by far the US' most comprehensive, has not kept up with changes in commuting patterns in the outer boroughs. The poor are especially underserved by mediocre transit systems since they are often forced to live in  locations providing poor access to job opportunities.<br/>5.  A dysfunctional health care system.<br/>6. Excess immigration. The flood of low-skilled immigrants into the US over the past generation has resulted in reduced opportunities for many poor people.<br/><br/>Raising the minimum wage to $15 is a band-aid to address a problem whose roots are far deeper and may well have unintended negative consequences for the poor.

One way would be to educate all voters to the point where they can understand public policy and make informed decisions about candidate's stances on the issues.

The Voters then choose Electors -- each elector must gather exactly 100 Voter votes to earn the right to be an elector,  and then the Electors are the ones who vote.  To be an Elector, full disclosure must be made of all investments, gifts, liabilities, etc,  Electors would thus represent a constituency of 1000 people, and presumably will be well-qualified enough to have their support.

2281,2281,"If the Fed starts raising rates in September it will turn out to be one of the greatest monetary policy blunders of all time!  There evidence is overwhelming against a central bank raising rates in a liquidity trap, even a little bit, during a post-financial-crisis type of recovery in which debt overhang is a major factor in restraining demand.  <br/><br/>The Bank of Japan made this mistake way back in the 1990s and the result was persistent deflation and lost decades.  More recently the Swedish Riksbank also made the exact same error and so did the ECB in 2011.  In both cases, the central banks very soon had to reverse course and their economies ended up even more depressed with even lower below-target inflation rates than had existed beforehand.<br/><br/>What's more, recent research by Amir Sufi has shown that in the current situation in which debtors tend to be lower income people with low credit scores the ability of low rates to stimulate demand is severely limited.  This largely explains the very slow recoveries and low inflation in advanced countries following the 2008 financial crisis despite the fact that central banks are holding interest rates at or near zero.  But the same research shows that while lowering rates has little stimulative effect on demand raising them is much more depressing. There is an asymmetry in the response to interest rate changes which is why raising rates will be far more disastrous than forecasters think.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.bis.org/events/agm2015/sp150628.pdf"" title=""https://www.bis.org/events/agm2015/sp150628.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bis.org/events/agm2015/sp150628.pdf</a>",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/upshot/the-economic-forecast-for-2016-and-what-it-means-for-the-election.html,0.0938340336134,1,0.418865546218,1

2365,2365,"I'm going to put a blunt metaphor out there with this dictum: :""The solution to pollution is dilution"".  This suggests that poverty and the attendant social ills can be seen as a form of ""pollution"" of human behavior.  Years ago I read about studies which found rises in rates of crime and what we typically refer to as ghetto behavior in places where the rates of indigence rose above a certain level.  That suggests to me that if a group of individuals moves into a neighborhood where most of the adults work, maintain responsible lives, and generally tend to stay out of trouble, they take on those values.  They try to emulate them.  Leading by example is a powerful thing.  When what you see around you is unemployment, crime and indolence, you internalize those values and accept that that is how things are.<br/><br/>I have dealt with the effects of concentrated poverty and have seen my own neighborhood go downhill as more poor moved in.  It has not been a pleasant experience and I empathize with those who write about having scraped and saved to afford a home.  I work hard to pay for and maintain my property as well.  Does the fact that there were already poor people around make someone less deserving of home value stability?  Does your wealth have to mean the maintenance of others' poverty?  It is the concentration of poverty that gives rise to ghettos.  Why do we even have ghettos?

2477,2477,"Another excellent article by Thomas Edsall with kudos' to Josh Bivens, as well, for his tutorial on Economics 101. The fact is, an export economy does not have to be as crippling an event as it has been in the United States. While it almost always is characterized by a 'race to the bottom' in wages, that does not always need to be the case. As a case in  point, look no further than Germany, a country whose economy is highly export driven and one who has not experienced the deleterious effect on wages and employment that we are witnessing in the United States. There are three primary reasons for this:<br/><br/>1) A strong unionized labor force. Union representation on the Board of Directors of every major corporation in Germany and union representatives work closely with corporate board members in setting the goals for the business.<br/>2) A strong social safety net.<br/>3) A functioning democracy rather than an oligopoly. While campaign spending is present, we are not talking of vast sums of money flooding the political process. Furthermore the inattention to the problems of the average citizen is not an effective political strategy when the need to develop effective coalitions with third parties is paramount.

The way to really help level out the playing field is raise taxes sharply on the top 1% and corporations and use the money to fund comprehensive, universal, single payer national health care with reasonable premiums and small co-pays on a ""sliding scale"". This benefits everyone. Next require mandatory private pensions, either 401 K or defined benefits, for all companies with over say 100 employees, as many European countries now do. Next make post secondary public education education, either technical or academic, ""dirt cheap"". In all cities over a million apply mandatory rent controls. But most importantly withdraw from all these unfair trade agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, WTO, etc., gradually raise tariffs and bring home millions of good paying industrial jobs with benefits. End illegal immigration and reduce legal immigration to no more than 200,00 per year instead of a million plus. If these few laws and policies were passed at the federal level you would wind up with a tiny but fluid upper class, a large and growing middle class, and a shrinking and small underclass.

But if we simply take money away from the 1% and redistribute it across the 99% without addressing the real reasons for the breakdown in upward mobility we will be kidding ourselves. We'll be right back where we started before long. Imagine a world where we genuinely work to overcome the ingrained systemic obstacles to equality of opportunity (vs. the lip service paid to this now) - there could be plenty of fully qualified people to take the place of the 1% for a little less pay. The competition would pull the highest wages and bonuses down to more reasonable levels.

2512,2512,"""I assume here that raising the minimum wage would not have reduced the income of those in the top 10 percent.""<br/><br/>Bad assumption. Unless productivity rises at a faster rate than wages (highly unlikely in the scenario presented), profits will be reduced by the exact amount of the wage increase. The top 10 percent gets a large portion of their income in dividends and capital gains, which are a residual of profits.

2513,2513,"The author talks about the bottom 90% versus the top 10%, and the economic inequality between the 2 groups. What the author conveniently ignores, and in fact most commentators in this column are ignoring, is that the top 10% is comprised primarily of professionals - doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. These are people who have spent years getting bachelors, masters, and PhD degrees, and have been successful at establishing a good career. It's not fair to demonize these people for all the hard work they have done to get to where they are, or say that they need to be pulled down in order to help the bottom 90%. Doesn't the American dream consist of working hard to get ahead? If we start pulling these people down, then what does that say about the value we place on hard work?<br/><br/>I do agree that favorable tax treatment of certain sources of income (e.g., capital gains for hedge fund managers) needs to be examined because they are being abused. But don't lump the upper middle class with the uber-rich - that's not fair to those who have worked hard to maintain that upper middle class lifestyle. <br/><br/>In my view, the way forward is to remove all the favorable tax exemptions and regulations and institute a flat tax for 99% of the population. Add an additional tax for incomes above $1 million, regardless of the source. Reduce the size of the IRS since tax submissions for the majority of the people will be very, very simple, and use these savings to fund programs for the needy.

2514,2514,"""(I assume here that raising the minimum wage would not have reduced the income of those in the top 10 percent.)""<br/><br/>This is not what my research shows. In fact, increasing the minimum wage does decrease the share of income going to (at least) the top 1% when you look at state-level data. Why is this? Because inequality is increasing because of a change in the relative bargaining power between workers and firms. As workers lose their bargaining power, the share of income going to the bottom 50% (or even bottom 90%) falls, and the share going to the top 1% rises.<br/><br/>So what can be done? Increasing the minimum wage is certainly one way to increase workers' bargaining power by setting a wage floor. Making it easier for workers to organize would be another way to increase bargaining power. And finally, increasing top marginal tax rates should also help by reducing the incentive executives have to reduce labor costs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/upshot/why-a-meaningful-boost-for-those-at-the-bottom-requires-help-from-the-top.html,0.239285714286,1,0.496428571429,1
