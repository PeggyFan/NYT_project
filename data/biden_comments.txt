0,"""Prepared to work"" is a different question depending on who is asked. Prepared to think critically is an art that grows from early youth but is augmented by the college experience. Recent college graduates are prepared to learn particular jobs. They are not prepared to do the jobs. The latter is ""OJT."" The provosts perhaps consider the growth in analytic skills but those skills are only a bit beyond apprentice level at the end of college. The employer would love to see engineers mature in the necessary mathematical skills but the recent college graduate is familiar with, not expert with those skills. The graduate is eager to work but often woefully aware of lack of specific skill maturity. Even for PhDs and MDs and JDs, skills grow rapidly in the first few years but continue to grow until cognitive decline interferes.<br/>Mentors so often shape how skills mature, on which skills to employ when, and how to interface with others. The mentors rightfully get credit for teaching which applications of skills to apply to specific problems and it is the success of those interactions that morph an early graduate into an effective worker/practitioner of an art.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html
1,"The times they are a changin'.....fast.  The mentors of yesteryear in our small town of less than 35,000 were the teachers in elementary, junior high and high school, our shop instructors, our coaches, our priest, our parents and our extended family of aunts and uncles. And, the best mentors of all were the folks who worked at the Coca-Cola distribution plant (as fork lift operators and delivery truck drivers), and the textile mills (as steam press operators and speckers) all their lives and served as models of why we might want to stay and finish college.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html
2,"Hmmm. Well, maybe money for class-size reduction is money well spent. Also, if teachers all have 30+ kids in their classes, and counselors, librarians, art teachers, etc. have all been cut from the budget (like has happened in CA), then there really are not enough grown-ups available for mentoring.

3,"Businesses used to train their workers. Now, of course, this has become a government responsibility to be paid for by the state and the students.  Education in many cases used to be more general, seeking to provided students with some level of cultivation and sophistication.  Now education means job training. I am not arguing against job training but job training is not exactly education in the larger sense. It seems to me that if businesses want pre- trained employees, trained to meet their needs  (what else is employer validated training programs) perhaps we should consider how such businesses might contribute. I am talking funding here.  After all the student benefits with a job, the community benefits by having employed citizens and the business benefits by having a trained employee. Since all beneift, it is only proper that all should contribute.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html
4,"Mr. Freidman has passed along conclusions of the Gallup interviews.  He, however, has failed to assess those conclusions within the broader discussion of the goals of our education system.  The opinions of the various groups interviewed reveal no surprises. If ours schools exist to move students into jobs, let industry set the curricula.  Administrators, employers, and for a brief interval, many students will report  high satisfaction.  But the average graduate may make 6 to 10 major career changes, and many of the new jobs will not have been invented at the time of graduation.  Such an educational system would produce a large poorly employable, frustrated population of workers and employers.<br/>I believe our schools need to teach students to think, to problem solve, and to be flexible.  A liberal arts exposure offers a bigger world view that better prepares students for a changing work place.  It also prepares graduates for responsible citizenship and, in my opinion, more fulfilling lives. Liberal arts teaching, however, is not the whole answer.  Schools must not loose sight of the goal of instilling in students a capacity for critical thinking.  The group of governors and educators that developed the concept of the Common Core curriculum understood this deficiency in our current education system.  My hope is that Mr Friedman and other respected writers will do more to focus on finding solutions to the problems of our schools.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html

13,"Anecdotally, I can only agree with this importance of work-study integration, and mentorship.<br/><br/>In Germany, where I graduated from high school, back then (1962) it was a requirement for most technical/engineering university students to complete a one-year ""Praktikum"" (internship, apprenticeship) related to the proposed field of study. Since I was aiming for aeronautical engineering, I worked for one year in a small aircraft factory, learning everything from the ground up, from properly drilling holes in metal, to riveting, to woking machine tools to mass produce small parts, to helping to assemble wings. There was also a good deal of sweeping and cleaning of work areas involved.<br/><br/>At college (I was lucky enough to ultimately be accepted at an American university), I was mentored and supported by a number of faculty, ultimately encouraging me to pursue a Masters program, and helping me apply for scholarships. Although I only worked in aerospace for about five years, this experience none the less gave me the experience and confidence to pursue other new fields and jobs throughout my career.<br/><br/>Also, in Germany, non-university education and job preparation is mostly accomplished through integrated work and classroom experiences, the work portion often being done as formal apprenticeship programs by mid-size and large employers. This has served Germany's competitiveness very well, although even there there is unmet demand for such skilled technical workers.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html
14,"Training employees who will ultimately move on is a fact of life. The younger generation today are accustomed to the reality that they will likely have a dozen or more employers over the course of their working careers.  <br/><br/>I had had a total of four employers (including my college years) until the age of 50 when I was reorganized out of a job at a large multi-national after more than 25 years; I always thought I would retire from that company. <br/><br/>Since then I've had five more employers (including my current position) and was reorganized out a further two of those jobs in favor of less-expensive, new hires. <br/><br/>Most employers today also accept this reality, the result being that they show a lack of commitment to their workers which is mirrored by their employees lack of commitment to the organization.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html
15,"Putting aside the cluelessness of high school/university leaders on job preparation or what counts in the work place, the personnel/training/location infrastructure required to train cannot adopt fast enough to keep up with the minute-by-minute advances of industry. Our problem, which Germany for example has addressed, is compartmentalizing knowledge and skills into what is taught in formalized schooling and what is applied in the real world---the workplace and formal schooling must be joined so the training infrastructure is perfectly aligned with knowledge and skills. The ""campus"" concept and design where students attend a specific location for a number of years must be replaced with a job concept where students go to industry locations for training. That training could include some form of a two year basic skill/knowledge training in formalized campus setting, but that training would gradually move to real world locations.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/opinion/thomas-friedman-it-takes-a-mentor.html

Colleges do a terrible job of providing sustained mentoring and apprenticeships - despite the fact that there is a staff of people called ""career counsellors"" in the employ.

It's just like training people for the ""trades"" (plumbers, electricians, HVAC repair workers, etc.); some jobs require that.  But, though some employers shortsightedly want ALL workers fully trained to do their jobs (and who wouldn't?!?), this is not helping the US develop people who can think.  Rather it is training people who can do jobs -- like trained apes or robots.<br/><br/>The US desperately needs high-level thinkers, and this comes only through true education, NOT training.

19,"""Busteed said that 96 percent of the college provosts Gallup surveyed believed their schools were successfully preparing young people for the workplace. “When you ask recent college grads in the work force whether they felt prepared, only 14 percent say ‘yes,’ ” he added.

The time to stop enemies is before they grow too dangerous, not after.  It is not a hard concept to understand.  Every major war in the last 100 years has been started by democrats.  That is no accident.  It is because democrats refuse to act decisively early on, allowing enemies to gain strength in their delays.  Even the pacifist Albert Einstein had to warn President Roosevelt to start militarizing due to the dangers that Germany was presenting early on.

43,"I'm sorry, Ms Dowd, but ""extreme excitement, outrage and sentimentality"" in the leader of the world's most powerful nation ARE suspect. And as we know from our own experience, ""flights of anxiety, worry and horror"" are indeed the ""enemies of lucid analysis."" You confuse them with their opposite: alertness, clear intention, and deliberate action.<br/><br/>I was far more alarmed by the emotion-driven GW Bush administration than I am by ISIS or Putin. Remember the feeling of dread you had when they were cooking up their excuse to invade Iraq (baring their teeth, as you put it)? Remember the feeling you had when it became starkly obvious that Rumsfeld's cocky assurance the US would leave Iraq ""in five weeks or five months,"" tops, was wildly unrealistic, and that there was ""no exit"" in sight--only years of pain and loss and nothing but failure to show for it?<br/><br/>Why anyone would want to repeat that kind of disaster (because that is what you would have President Obama risk) is beyond me. Maybe the incessant buzz of decidedly un-nuanced social media quips and the simplistic picture of war and diplomacy portrayed by TV shows have blunted your sense of history, if not your actual memory.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-is-it-wwiii-or-just-twitter.html
44,"Even bright writers like Dowd can't escape a presentist bias; history must be evaluated from our own perspective, things right now must always be worse/better/unique. If two beheadings are an abomination, then I'm curious what word would describe the Holocaust. Or the fetid trenches of Verdun. Or the Spanish Flu Pandemic, with children dying at their school desks. Or the Spanish Inquisition. Dowd may be making journalistic hay with her constant jibs at our detached, pedantic president - he's an easy target by now - but this time he's dead on. The world has always been ""messy,"" or horrific, if you prefer less buffered language. But these days, our access to data, and the way those data are packaged, make us feel as if it's never been this bad. Ironically, even as Dowd argues that media technology is not distorting how we evaluate events, the e-issue of the Times in which her column occurs has an embedded video about West Point on its electronic front page, ads swimming across its banners, and I'm posted this comment on the Good Grey Lady's linked blogs.

45,"Richard Haass' comment gets at the heart of the elite media's complaint about Barrack Obama: ""The world is more disorderly for all kinds of reasons, he said, including the loss of confidence in American reliability and the American model...""<br/><br/>The difficulty with this argument is that the American bus was already going over the cliff when Obama took the driver's seat.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly America has contributed to the morass in the Middle East and South Asia as several decades of faulty policy have brought about a wave of unintended consequences. But the larger historical forces grinding out in the region are a breakup of epic proportions of a century of troubled history in the region, much of it marred by imperialism and colonialism. <br/><br/>Implicit in Haass' and Maureen Dowd's argument is that a different or ""better"" president would result in better outcomes for America. This is unlikely. Obama's policies may in fact be ""best"" for the time being. Restraint and disengagement may be the best approaches at this time.<br/><br/>What is needed is a different argument about having a completely different American foreign policy for the region.

She completely ignores an excellent example of the effectiveness of Mr. Obama's quiet focus - the killing this week by US airstrike of Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.  As President Obama said, ""We don't forget and our reach is long.""<br/><br/>Comparisons with My Lai and Abu Ghraib are irrelevant - the people were not Americans.  As much as we like to pretend we care about people around the world, it was not until two American journalists were beheaded that most of us, including most media outlets, started to pay attention.  ISIS has been beheading children, selling young girls and summarily executing thousands of Syrians and Iraqis for months.<br/><br/>To suggest that Mr. Obama blames social media for ISIS is absurd.

Under our present constitution and laws, there is none, which is why we will ultimately be dwarfed by China, which chooses its leaders without all the nonsense we use. China's method of choosing leaders has its own weaknesses, but they pale in comparison to ours. A 2013 Gallup poll said that most Americans get their news about current events from the mainstream TV media, which means the TV media controls the minds of most Americans. The TV media, for example, will make Americans believe that ISIS is a bunch of savages, yet the TV media purposely does not show all the heads of Iraqis that were cut off by Americans. When I say that to people, they say, ""There were no Iraqi heads cut off by Americans."" I reply, ""In the 2003 war against Iraq, the U.S. and its allies killed more than 100,000 Iraqis. What do you think happens when a missile or bomb hits an Iraqi home? People get blown to bits. Some get their heads cut off. Certainly there have been thousands of Iraqis who had their heads cut off by American bombs, missiles, artillery and tank rounds, mortar strikes, hand grenades and high caliber machine guns. The U.S. TV media purposely hides all these U.S.-caused decapitations because the TV media wants to demonize Muslims as part of its self-appointed propaganda role to demonize Muslims and whitewash American brutality.

Iran will be motivated to develop a nuclear weapon in the face of American and Israeli aggression. The opposition to the authoritarian regime in Iran will be completely undermined. Further negotiation with Iran will be precluded. Iran will develop a nuclear weapon in the near future. And yes, the bomb will have your names on it Senators Schumer and Menendez and Prime Minister Netanyahu, as will a war against Iran instigated by the US and Israel!  Opposition to the Iran deal by Republicans and assorted Democrats is just like the run-up to the war in Iraq, mindless demagoguery promoting fear in the American citizenry. Give peace a chance!

That was a long time ago, and I don’t remember exactly, but Stanton – in his younger, more rambunctious days -- was frequently in a lot of strange places. First prize I recall was about 75 pounds of steaks, hamburgers and chicken parts, but second place was still a lot of meat.<br/><br/>Anyway my friend fancied himself a bit of a sharpster, good at bridge, poker, scrabble, crossword puzzles, Monopoly, pool, jazz piano, ordering off-the-menu in Chinese restaurants and women. He always drove convertibles and worked as infrequently as he could, usually in the used car business. A student, in other words, of things that make life pleasant, he was totally delighted with himself for winning this prize.<br/><br/>So we packed all the meat into the back of his convertible and drove it about 100 miles where we left it at the front-door of his current girl-friend’s apartment. Trouble is his girlfriend was away somewhere auditioning for a part in a play, and by the time she got back the meat was as high as an elephant’s eye.<br/><br/>That is the way it is sometimes with memorable victories like his and the one that now seems to be lurking on the horizon for President Obama.

Their families are of no small consequence because I'd expect that members of each family will campaign for each candidate.  All of the Vice President's children have worked in public service.  Both sons have served in the military with tours in Afghanistan to their credit.  Beau's career in public service ended way to soon, and he was well loved by his constituents in Delaware.  His daughter is a social worker and she runs a nonprofit serving victims of domestic violence.  His wife is a teacher and works tirelessly for needs of military families.<br/>The Clinton family has cashed in big on the popularity of President Clinton.  Chelsea is an investment banker and receive $70,000 in speaking fees so she can talk about diarrhea.  Chelsea's husband is to a hedge fund manager.   President Clinton carries a lot of baggage, still.  The man is still a hound dog, and he creeps me out.  And, the idea of a cabinet member who has an e-mail account linked to a private server smacks of entitlement of the highest caliber.<br/>Joe has had a few gaffes.  But, the man has integrity and character.  He is respected within the Democratic and the Republic parties, and knows how to reach across the aisle to get work done.

He is an immensely ambitious man who for years has been looking for any opening to run for the White House.  This is evident from the cosmetic changes he effected some years ago.

He was right, however, on Iraq when he recommended that there was no hope for a nation there and that it would be best to divide the population according to tribal lines.  Nevertheless, despite Lindsay Graham's tears of affection, Biden's thirty-six years in the Senate has made him another hack.  His real competition, however, is not Hillary Clinton but Bernie Sanders.  Hillary is about to flame out, but Bernie remains strong in his convictions and support, though I agree with none of what he represents.

Joe Biden has no such connections. Saudi infiltration of US mosques with radical anti Israel and US rhetoric has cost US lives and will continue to do so. Inhumane bombing and blockade by Saudis is killing thousands of civilians while they are allied with al Queda. Seriously doubt Hillary would stand up to them like Obama has.

450,"Jeb!'s dissembling - that he really meant part-time workers should work full-time - is obviously not what he really meant because it could not produce anything close to a 4% growth rate.  If 6 million people working 20 hours per week were working 40 hours per week they would add only 2% to total hours worked (in our labor force of 140 million).  Increasing our current growth rate, which is 2.9% by two percent would only increase it to 2.96%.<br/>Lest conservatives claim that also reversing the decline in our labor force participation rate would make up the difference, it would not even come close.  Our labor force participation rate has only declined 2% recently.  Another 2% increase in a growth rate of 2.96% increases it only to 3.02%.<br/><br/>Studies have shown that most of the people working part-time want to work more hours but employers are not creating the jobs.  Studies have also shown that most of the recent 2% decline in the labor force is due to retirement of the baby boom population.  So, Jeb!'s theory of how to get to 4% growth is based upon people who want to work more but can't and people want to work less and can retire.<br/><br/>I think the political point Jeb! was communicating was another version of Mitt Romney's 47% comment.  That is we could have a 4% growth rate if only those takers would work.<br/><br/>Jeb!, growth was only 4% when you were Governor of Florida right before the housing bubble burst.

Since the Shiite owned most of the oil reserves because reserves were located in the Shiite Crescent, they voted as a block, won the election, and locked the Sunni out of the process because they controlled no oil at all.<br/><br/>That the Shiites would consolidate to control most of Iraq's oil was highly predictable.

He was no longer on national TV. He was CENSORED.<br/>He was not jailed, but his financial livelihood was diminished, taken away by CENSORSHIP – USA style – remember McCarthy and Agnew?

We had been to so many formal dinners with so many long-winded official speeches on both sides, patiently translated by one young Chinese interpreter. At the final dinner the head of the Australian delegation made another long speech.

525,"KILLING THEM SOFTLY  While survivors of rape may not be prime targets to be gunned down in the streets, failing to test their rape kits and prosecute alleged rapists is yet another form of violence, which, I would wager to say, is disproportionately perpetrated against women of color.  That violence is being perpetrated by the very persons sworn to uphold the law and protect the peace.  While their names must be protected, I believe that the federal government must immediately investigate police negligence in failing to test DNA evidence in a timely manner.  The situation is insidious and invisible, since nobody can take videos of the violence as it happens.  The trauma of rape often has a profound effect on survivors, who are reinjured by the failure of the legal system to be responsive to them.  While the shooting of black men in the streets is the focus of a new era of civil rights challenges, the women and men who have been subjected to sexual violence must also have their civil rights protected.  Let's hope that Loretta Lynch, the newly appointed Attorney General, will address the neglect of the processing of rape kits along with violence in the streets.

562,"One problem with this analysis is that it doesn't acknowledge the role that delegate selection rules have on determining who is a viable candidate.  In earning the nomination, it's all about gaining the most delegates to the national party convention.  Elites play an outsize role in part because a large chunk of delegates are super delegates, not selected by any primary or caucus process.  These are party national committee members and elected officials.  Delegate allocation rules deny any delegates to any candidate who fails to achieve at least 15 percent of the vote, preventing slightly more marginal candidates in a crowded field from gaining traction.  On the Republican side, most States have winner-take-all delegate allocation rules, so a candidate who receives less than 40 percent of the vote in a competitive 3-candidate primary could nonetheless win all the delegates from that State.  A long, drawn-out nominating process such as the 2008 Obama-Clinton contest would be virtually impossible to see happen in the Republican nominating process.  The Democratic Party is somewhat more democratic in allocating delegates proportionally, once a candidate exceeds the 15 percent minimum.

584,Apart from Goldwater and McGovern there is Alf Landon in 1936 (36% of the vote. Dorothy Parker said if he made any more speeches FDR would have carried Canada).

One can predict now with a reasonable degree of certainty what the maximum Republican vote will be (~62 million) in 2016 whoever is their candidate. This is the maximum for the optimum candidate who is actually someone rather bland like Romney. Both Bush and Cruz would probably get somewhat but not massively less. Bush because the entire Bush 2 presidency is going to get re-litigated and Cruz because like Goldwater there is a lingering suspicion he's nuts. Btw 1964 was the first election I ever voted in.

It is worth mentioning in this context a basic moral axiom: that people should not be punished for conditions, attributes or actions that they are powerless to affect.

The very reason Mr. Jenner is ""going media"" on this issue is because of the misunderstanding and avoidance of a topic that still rates a taboo in our culture.  If you are born and perceived as one gender, how dare you challenge that and ""choose"" to become something else. Maybe that is why so few people can 'come out' about the torment they have endured in bodies that do not reflect who they are. We don't often see headlines about the pain and agony they suffer, nor their suicides or rejection by their families and society, or their loss of jobs. I am often reminded lately as our population seems to become every more intolerant and judgmental, that we should not judge until we have walked in another's shoes. Shame to all of you who could only see a person who was searching for a limelight....I believe Mr. Jenner is searching for his ""sunlight"", and whatever other failings he may have had in his life, he will be a beacon for those who hide within the trappings of a gender that does not match their souls.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/opinion/nicholas-kristof-bruce-jenners-courage.html

Given that Hollywood welcomes this sort of thing, I have to wonder how truly courageous his change is. When I think of teenagers who come out in schools where they are likely to get bullied, parents of transgendered kids who make the decision to publicly support a child's decision at great social cost, or the legions of LGBT individuals how have fought tirelessly in their workplaces and communities to be recognized as full human beings, I have to say, Mr. Kristof, you are way off here.

It is very difficult for the cis-gendered to understand what it is like to be trans, and few can ever appreciate what it was like to grow up in the 50's knowing that your body was a constant affront to your sense of self.   I tried desperately to be ""normal"" and be who everyone told me I was.  I buried my real self and lived behind a façade for decades.  But eventually the façade crumbles.  It simply becomes impossible to keep up the front any longer.  It can only be even more difficult for someone like Jenner who is in the public eye.<br/><br/>It is extremely dificult to be trans, even in a place like New York City.  According to a study done by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, 41% of the transgender population has attempted suicide, nine times the national average.  I and every trans person I know decided to transition because we knew that suicide was the likely alternative.  Trust me, there are FAR easier ways for Jenner to attract attention than to transition.<br/><br/>Transgender people don't seek any special privileges, or special accommodations.

Many liberal and moderate economists thought a 1.5 billion (10% the size of the economy) would've been the correct amount due to depth and breadth of financial collapse of the economy. Critics will say the president could only get 800 billion but he never tried to push for more. Does anyone think that FDR in a similar circumstance would've ended with only 800 billion?<br/><br/>The ACA is a great accomplishment but it is largely Romney's Massachusetts' healthcare initiative, Dole's plan in the 90s and Nixon's in the 70s. <br/><br/>He nominated Secretary Clinton to state and held over Gates at defense and nominated Geithner at treasury and AG Holder at Justice. Clinton is and was more hawkish than Obama, Gates is a moderate Republican, Geithner was head of the New York Fed under Bush and worked in the Clinton administration under Larry Summers and Robert Rubin who succeeded in deregulating parts of the financial industry in the 90s.   AG Holder made his bones in the legal world as a corporate lawyer.<br/><br/>Obama's NSA and drone polices are and were more intrusive hawkish more than Bush's.<br/><br/>He and AG Holder have prosecuted more illegals than Bush.<br/><br/>He has said the nation needs social security reform which is code for cutbacks.<br/><br/>There is more but the NYT has a word limit.",http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/opinion/charles-blow-the-obama-opposition.html

He plays well to all those who want America to be great again.  They want someone to regain the illusion of respect from the rest of the world.  Trump represents the power they think they lost, but really never had.  Yes, the U.S. is still a huge superpower militarily and still manages a large part of the world economy.  Many Americans want to believe that everyone envies them, and many do.  They envy Trump and his power, and they think everyone else will or should envy him too.  They don't realize that many people see Wizard of Oz behind the curtain with all his flaws.<br/>I'm waiting for one of the other candidates to make it more obvious that the President can't enact laws, but he can call on the military to invade a country.  Trump couldn't get any of his ideas through congress, but he could start a nuclear war.

The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells.” I for one am so tired of the liberal wing  - they have destroyed the safety net with their welfare reform.

He’s a wonderful man and a great public servant, but he should not run for president this year, for the sake of his long-term reputation.”<br/><br/> A “wonderful man and a great public servant” is unlikely to win so he should sit out of the race to preserve his reputation? That's cynical, but suggesting that a man’s personal grief is a great rebranding or campaigning opportunity is just shameful.<br/><br/>In Stephen Colbert’s interview, Joe Biden wasn’t describing grief and loss as formative forces, he was explaining that his bedrock of family and faith help him through his grief when losses occur.  He didn’t single himself out as special, but instead repeated that he knew others have suffered tragedies with less support, so he felt fortunate.  He also gave a candid glimpse of why public service is important to him.<br/><br/>I encourage Mr. Brooks to watch the interview again. What Mr. Biden revealed that is truly refreshing for a career politician was humility.

When it comes to being an advocate of social and economic justice for all citizens, Mr. Sanders stands head and shoulders above all the candidates for the Oval office.  His whole political career has been built on social justice - he has stuck to his principles from day one, which is why in New Hampshire, a state which supports individual freedom and conviction has re-elected him time and again.<br/><br/>It's wonderful to see him in a upward trajectory in the polls, despite being marginalized by the media.  The media unduly stresses a candidate's campaign warchest as the basis of a candidates viability rather the true values of a given candidate. Senator Sanders transcends this narrow approach and it's refreshing that voters are looking beyond the $$$$ signs.  Blacks in America should take note of this candidate.

Biden's authenticity and close connection with his emotional self were about as transparent as an American politician has allowed him or herself to be in recent memory.<br/>I have generally admired Biden's political inclinations and commitments over the course of his career. There have, to be sure, been some speed bumps, sometimes mere gaffes, other times more serious failings.But if some critics, like a former CIA and Defense Dept. chief, think that Biden has been consistently wrong on foreign policy, I would beg to differ. I think he has been mostly right, that he knows more about foreign policy than virtually any of the other candidates, and that his foreign policy inclinations suit me far better than his equally knowledgable competitors. On domestic policy, I think he understands the needs of working people as well as anyone.<br/>I personally ""feel the Bern""; Bernie Sanders suits me better than any candidate I can remember since the 1960s. I think the media, including The Times, owes him more respect and deeper coverage than he has so far received. I hope he wins in Iowa and N. H., and turns the political world on its head.

1169,"Joe Biden is a great American public servant, with the character of those of the Greatest Generation.  It would be good for the country if he did run and win.<br/><br/>My concern for him, if he were able to recover enough from his grief to be elected, is that he would have the same issue that President Obama has had: He has no Bobby.  President Kennedy's brother Robert  was completely committed to him, his values and goals. He was sounding board, advisor, ambassador to other officials and departments, and political watchdog.  He also spoke the truth to the president.  Robert Kennedy was John Kennedy's best friend.<br/><br/>In losing Beau Biden, our vice president lost not only his son, but also his best friend.  From everything I have  read, they were as close as the Kennedy brothers.  They too shared the same values and goals.  Beau understood the political world.   He would have been the person President Biden would have turned to during difficult times.  Beau would have been President Biden's Bobby.<br/><br/>The presidency is such a lonely job that anyone who holds the office needs a Bobby or a Beau.  Few have been so fortunate.  I am not saying that Joe Biden is a weak man.  He is a very strong man.  Still, I worry that the loneliness of the job, combined with his grief, would make the job even more difficult.  <br/><br/>I think this is the heart of the decision he faces.  I wish him well.

I think they are correct that this deserves some criticism. But I do not think how Biden handled the hearings is sufficient to be dispositive with regard to his character then or candidacy today. As chair of the Judiciary Committe, Biden had to make the hearings as fair as possible. The NY Times reported in 2008:<br/>//<br/>At one point, Senator Biden’s aides[,] and then he[,] told Ms. Abramson and Ms. Mayer that digging in too deep on Mr. Thomas’s intellectual legal prowess would’ve been a problem. One aide said, “it was a racial thing.” Mr. Biden himself said, “There was in fact a concern about whether or not to make the guy look stupid – what would happen if you embarrassed him.”<br/>//<br/>Biden voted against Thomas's nomination.<br/><br/>In 2008, then Senator Obama said: ""I would not have nominated Clarence Thomas. I don’t think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation."" Even Senator Obama, 17 years later, declined to pillory Justice Thomas regarding the sexual harassment charges.<br/><br/>I remember when Paula Jones charged President Clinton with sexual harassment.

The heading of the article stating that joe Biden expresses doubts is this paper's clear attempt to obfuscate the truth. It is evident that the NY. Times wants Hillary Clinton to be the candidate. Choosing the word doubt is a misleading choice of word to describe Biden's mind. If someone asks me a question and I answer ""I doubt it""...it almost always means no. Or not able to. This is not the case with Biden. He is not expressing doubt, that implies an inability to do the job. He is, in my mind, expressing his desire to take a bit more time to come to terms with the enormity of the task. Two different things.<br/>My other thought is simpler.

But did any of them set up an email server so that they could completely control the e-mails?  Don't think so.<br/><br/>Her lies and excuses about the e-mail are simply amazingly brazen.  Does it really make sense that the secretary of state of the US wouldn't send or receive classified material?  Or, if she was sending e-mails as SOS, who was making the determination of which of her e-mails should be marked classified?  Hillary?  <br/><br/>More astounding was her completely idiotic claim that she wanted to have one device.  As almost everyone knows these days, you can have two (or more) e-mail accounts on a single device -- just like you can read the Times and the WSJ on the same i-pad or i-phone.<br/><br/>And so now a half apology.  No admission of wrong doing, but she does confess she wasn't thinking at the time.  Really?  That will get your confidence right up there.<br/><br/>So, let's review -- arrogant, not trustworthy, more scandals than accomplishments (but maybe not failures), and let's not forget she's been riding Bill's coattails since Little Rock.

Sex, as every adult knows, often involves a dominance/dominated dynamic that is often - though not always - part of the pleasure. From what I've read about this case, physical harm does not seem to be an issue. And who's to know the degree of lasting psychological harm caused by the  sexual contact or that caused by this public exposure, which has surely caused lasting harm to both parties. Of course, sexual assault cannot be condoned. But compared to the blatant irresponsibility of the administration at St. Paul's in allowing the ""senior salute"" to take place, the actions of these two immature young people are merely foolish.

1350,"The basic conclusion here that laws must change to favor a claim of rape despite the lack of evidence of force takes as given that the importance of giving legal remedy to girls and women who claim they have been raped is higher in priority than protecting the rights of all others. That's simply unreasonable.<br/><br/>What it does is place immense power in the hands of females over males, females who could have motives for punishing the male that have nothing to do with any alleged crime that might have been committed by the male.<br/><br/>That's not who we are. Everyone deserves to be treated equivalently, and nobody should be convicted of a crime lacking evidence that a crime occurred, simply because someone claimed it did.<br/><br/>The facts as they've been presented in this case and reported suggest strongly that what happened should never have been called ""rape"" and certainly should never have gone to trial. What it also strongly suggests is that if the girl wasn't mentally challenged and did not wish to engage in sex, then she had no business being in that mechanical room with Labrie.<br/><br/>This could be interpreted far more rationally as a failure of parenting than as a failure of law.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/magazine/the-st-pauls-rape-case-shows-why-sexual-assault-laws-must-change.html

1353,"The problem is not exclusively a clear and unambiguous legal standard but a new social standard.  I start with a bias toward believing the girl but it is hard to have convicted the boy based on ambiguities in the girl's testimony coupled with lack of physical or third party evidence.  It's hard for adults who stumbled through sexual experimentation to see a different path toward sexual consent, but I believe that the future foundation of legally risk free sex for boys will have to be some form of clear consent not lack of resistance.  Frankly, it could even be a selfie with both parties giving a thumbs up.  Stumbling toward sexual experimentation with alcohol, peer pressure, differences in age, and differences in perceptions of whether there is/was consent leaves both parties too vulnerable.

Maybe it's time we started teaching both females and males it's okay to like sex, and it doesn't have to be some sort of game.  Then we have ridiculous laws that don't take into,account the difference between over hormonal teens and actual violent rape or incest.  This kid has to register as a sex offender -- absurd.

The whole case was very unfortunate for everyone, from the girl who, I believe, truly believed she was raped, to the boy who thought it was consensual.
