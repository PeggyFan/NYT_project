Trump represents the power they think they lost, but really never had.  Yes, the U.S. is still a huge superpower militarily and still manages a large part of the world economy.  Many Americans want to believe that everyone envies them, and many do.  They envy Trump and his power, and they think everyone else will or should envy him too.  They don't realize that many people see Wizard of Oz behind the curtain with all his flaws.<br/>I'm waiting for one of the other candidates to make it more obvious that the President can't enact laws, but he can call on the military to invade a country.  Trump couldn't get any of his ideas through congress, but he could start a nuclear war.  If more people start thinking about Trump in terms of Commander in Chief, the more they'll rethink their support for his bombastic, juvenile approach to the real world.<br/>Thank you for listening to my rant.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/opinion/losers-poker.html,0.134512987013,0.495616883117

1015,1015,"Mr. Davidson, states that the actual cost of educating a student in college can be as high as $100,000 per year.  The question is why?  Why does it cost that much to produce a graduate in history, or English?   We need to look at the ""core cost of education"".  By ""core cost"" I mean the total budget of all the departments ay a university, the salaries of faculty and staff in the departments, who actually do the teaching.  Then we will better understand how much goes into support structures, such as physical facilities and libraries and para-educational expenses such as administration.  Like hospitals, universities are able to set their tuition at rates that have no real bearing with the actual cost of producing a graduate in a particular subject. They probably don't even know. I am sure with public pressure universities can cut their para-educational expenses.

There's a lot that could work better about Texas, but one of the things to admire about the state is that there were no major tensions or hostilities between its majority population, its substantial Hispanic minority, and the reality that, as a border state, the presence of Latino immigrants was a given.

1101,1101,"Bobby Jindal has never struck me as a completely rational human being, however, I was totally knocked out by his extraordinarily brave description of Donald Trump. “Donald Trump is not a serious candidate,’’ Jindal told reporters at the National Press Club. “He’s a narcissist.

The reality is that I want to say what everybody is thinking about Donald Trump but afraid to say.’’  and  “Donald Trump is shallow,’’ Jindal said. “Has no understanding of policy. He’s full of bluster. He has no substance. He lacks the intellectual curiosity to even learn. You can’t argue policy with this guy.

The impressive and accomplished George Clooney is almost always a very thoughtful, witty, and articulate interview, but Mr. Colbert chose to veer to the simply silly and do shtick with him instead.  The Jeb Bush interview was clearly marred by heavy-handed editing (perhaps of necessity?).   The Oreos segment was juvenile and much too long. The bright spots were Mr Colbert's brief homage to David Letterman and the musical finale, a wonderful show-ending feature Mr. Colbert occasionally gifted us with on his previous show.

With the character on, he could do a lot of things that seemed funny when you know he's ""acting"": A narcissistic fool is funny; a narcissistic normal guy who coves the ceiling with his portraits is not.<br/>2. Losing his CR persona also meant losing a lot of the sharper, sarcastic humor, when he pretended to be someone else and showed the absurdness of their opinions. I feel like this kind of humor would be lost in the new audience - the masses are unlikely to follow the premise of the make-believe character, just as they would also probably miss the humor of the more sophisticated jokes from the Colbert Report. As a super CR fan, i showed it to some friends who just didn't get it - a smart person telling smart jokes might just not be that popular when presented to people who aren't really that big on thinking.

There was too much political humor. More Trump jokes? After a summer of preparation? The sing-a-long at the end reminded me of a charity event from the 80s especially when I muted it.

It seems impossible to get Congress or the White House to force basic changes to the tax codes where the wealthy pay at least the same percentage in taxes as those who bear the brunt of government spending today.

Similarly, Debe Tehrar (wife of a conservative Republican in the State legislature) was elected President of the Ohio State Board of Education with Kasich's support.  In 2013 when it was found that she had compared Pres. Obama to Hitler on her Facebook page, Kasich continued to support her.  Without complaint from Kasich, she also favored censorship of books she personally found offensive, e.g. Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye, stating that she didn't want her grandchildren reading it and she didn't ""want anyone else's children reading it.""  Kasich also appointed Cathye Florye to the State Board of Education in 2014 - she is on record as stating that children should be taught creationism in schools. Kasich's School Board appointee, Mark Smith, has a record of ranting against teachers who fail to teach biblical truth.<br/><br/>In sum, even though Kasich presents a relatively ""moderate"" stance within the Republican Party, I fear that, were he to ever be President, he would placate the hard right of his party to our nation's detriment.

For example, does human life evolve in stages (kinetics, sensitivity, viability, etc.), or should we distinguish personhood from mere human life?

Typical journalese distortion.  Why? To position the Times as centrist? <br/><br/>This line was already roundly criticized by comments in the article. Sanders’ solutions are mostly quite centrist by US past standards or current ones abroad. <br/><br/>No, what’s radical is the right wing that trashed our former middle class security and appropriated the country’s resources and productivity for the top elites.  They accomplished this with a rich, constitutional democracy—that’s radical. Both parties now talk ‘inequality’ for 2016—they have to—but can’t go too far.<br/><br/>Our anger isn’t diffuse—it’s specific. And please no warnings of the EU far right and left in the same paragraph as Bernie Sanders.<br/>And how can you compare the US with UK, so blithely?  The UK with all its problems has 2 things the US can’t achieve---generations long h/c for all, at lower cost. And short campaigns not paid for by billionaires.  <br/><br/>Instead of ignoring these huge contrasts, could you write a column on them? You are well positioned to do it.

1870,1870,"When the US economy collapsed during the 1930's, voters were angry enough to support rather radical changes.

No crisis in sight.  <br/><br/>However, many feel that it wouldn't make much difference whether Bush or Clinton were elected.  That's true only in part because presidential powers are very limited.  The parties' policy shifts are also unpredictable.<br/><br/>After all, who gave us mass incarceration?  Who gave us mass loss of privacy in domestic communications?  Who gave us the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was the greatest threat to our existence in many decades?  Who made us warriors in the Middle East with the ""Carter Doctrine?""

There was no place for the Sunnis to turn from then on other than to groups like ISIS to counter Maliki's pro-Iran Shiite regime.

In November 1998 I lived in Minnesota and woke up early one morning to the news we had elected the wrestler, Jesse Ventura to be the governor of Minnesota. ""It can't happen here"", happened.  At the time, a lot of people didn't think it was possible. He was a joke! He attended televised debates in a sweat shirt and sweat pants because he was going to go coach his sons soccer team right after the debate. He had advertising featuring two kids playing with plastic action figures who looked like corporate wonks getting beat up by a Jesse Ventura action figure.  He was regarded more as  a clown among ""serious"" political voices and the media. And then he won. His perfect political storm happened under similar conditions to that of the Donald Trump circus. His opponents for the job, a democrat and a republican, were so exceedingly boring and uncharismatic, that it was simply a delight to watch Ventura on television with them. He came across as one of us. In the last few days of the campaign his popularity lit up and surged. He was elected at the peak of the wave in early November. That may play differently for Trump. With this endless election nonsense going on for months. Trump is peaking now, and that may be where he fails. Can he spout all that hot air for the next 14 months? Time will tell and ""it can't happen here"" may happen here. ",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/us/politics/why-donald-trump-wont-fold-polls-and-people-speak.html,0.0207556935818,0.40983436853

Supporting someone who  merely ""echoes how you feel"" but has no demonstrable record of doing anything in the public arena (i.e., building a business empire and making a lot of money for yourself does not count) just shows that you are a sucker.

1961,1961,"Hi. My name is Skyler Knopp, a final year college student in Orlando. I will tell you why Donald Trump is appealing.<br/>He is very successful in his own personal endeavors, on an astronomical scale. The world respects him as a business mind. He speaks the truth for once among politicians, when he says how much of a bad position our nation is in. The situation is VERY grave.. Who else among the candidates will be able to pull us out? I like Bernie, but does he really have the business sense to pull us put of 19 trillion dollars of debt, and a stagnant, dying service industry?<br/><br/>Few educated, kind hearted poeople like his antagonizing statements.

Just think of the choice words they would use to describe the English, a and our nation feels as if it has fallen to a lower depth than that. As an oligarchy, our nation has become just what it was never meant to be.<br/>Maybe, just maybe, Trump can change that. His only vested interest in running for president seems to be saving the nation. He has lost a lot of money running for president.

Hillary has not brought anything new to the table. So in this  stagnant vacuum of mass cynicism, we now have Bernie Sanders on the left and Trump on the right. It will be interesting to see if Obama officially stays neutral in the next month.

To me the running mate is crucial as it is not just an indicator of who may be the President someday, but it also gives a measure of the candidates personality and biases. In the case of Bush II, Cheney was such an obviously poor choice it declared that the so-called ""compassionate conservative"" was being strongly manipulated. For McCain, I actually was following him intently until he picked Palin. Disaster. For Romney, I didn't know Ryan but since it turned out he follows the Gospel According to Ayn Rand, the philosophy that most people outgrow by the time they graduate college, ugh. Obama clearly understood that he was not warm and fuzzy so he chose warm and fuzzy Biden. Safe and a nice complement, but showed no boldness. Trump? Would he pick Fiorina?

2045,2045,"The concept of All Lives Matter is more nuanced than some would have you believe. After two NYPD officers were gunned down in their car, a Blue Lives Matter movement took hold. Not surprisingly, the Black and Blue movements became politicized and somewhat oppositional. ""All lives matter"" was initially an attempt at a ""can't we all get along?"" message. Over time, it went from being considered a milquetoast moderate to being considered racist and even violent (according the BLM activist Julius Jones). To observers, ALM is seen BLM, while those who say it will tell you it is just a more inclusive echo of BLM. In this article, the author lumps in Martin O'Malley with Huckabee, perhaps in an attempt to create some false equivalence between the two parties. But Huckabee's use of the term was planned and perhaps a dog whistle to his base. O'Malley used the term somewhat under duress while being confronted and later apologized for it. Bernie Sanders who happened to be present at the time has even been accused of using the term, though I don't believe he has.<br/><br/>Here's the irony. We're told, by people like Julius Jones, that white people are the ones who need to get the message and often don't.

However, to own a gun you need a license and having a gun takes a big responsibility. What Walter J Palmer did was a huge mistake because one is to follow the law that abides to one when they travel and also because he murdered an endangered species so that another mistake he made. Yes, lions are just animals but this falls into the category of poaching that they kill them and sell their shin for a ridiculous amount of money that we as the people won’t get anything but the fact that these lions are decreasing in numbers and in the future there is a possibility that our these lions won’t live in the wild. On the other hand we have the fault as well. The reason for this is why wasn’t security at their most attentive state to have this incident happen. When Walter J Palmer shot his gun I’m sure that the sound of the gun would have brought a lot of attention to himself. The only question is why the US in such an outrage is for this death but when it comes to a colored person people are siding with the most thing that is appropriate which is the “good guy” or the police.

2140,2140,"Im not making ""light"" of the valid points the contest winner's letter addresses.  The fact black men are killed by police, seemingly common, is also abhorrent, god-forsaken (so to speak), and awful.  In my humble opinion the outrage and public outcry directed at Walter J Palmer, and big-game hunting in general, is mostly due to the fact Lions (in the case of Cecil) and other big-gamespecies are endangered and near extinction.  Im not saying a Lion's life is more valuable than a human being's.  What I am saying is that public awareness has finally tipped and the fact that there are roughly 30,000 African Lions left here on Terra Firma is the driving force behind public outcry.  <br/><br/>Big-game safari $$'s only go into the hands of a few... it's a fact that hunting these creatures has not helped preserve them.  Not only are big-game animals' numbers decreasing because of hunting and poaching, but moreso due to the continued encroachment of mankind on these magnificent animals' habitat.  <br/><br/>I do agree there is some hypocrisy w/in the general public's outcry, but at least the death of Cecil has brought the issue(s) of extinction, endangered animals, pros &amp; cons of big-game hunting, et., to the front page.  Matt's points were not lost on me, as they are valid.  However we the people mist act now to protect these endangered species before it's too late.

2141,2141,"Eye Shape May Help Distinguish Predator From Prey<br/>August 7, 2015<br/>Nicholas St. Fleur<br/>What interested me most in The Times this week was the different pupil shape of each animal. I did not notice the different shapes until I read this article. I have been drawing a cat’s pupils with vertical pupils ever since I was young, but never once thought about the different pair of eyes that animals have: horizontal, vertical, and rounded pupils. It is very interesting how scientists and researchers can tell if the animal is a predator or a prey, depending on what type of pupil they have.<br/>I picked this article because I did not know that animals with horizontal pupils (grazing animals) can better detect predators approaching them from different directions. It is because there is “more light captured from the left and right of the eye and less light from below and above the eye.” And what is also fascinating is that when the grazing animal bends its head to the ground to eat, “the eyes actually rotate as much as fifty degrees when the head turns downward, keeping the pupils parallel to the ground.” Another interesting feature of this article is when it mentions the vertical eye shaped. Researchers found that vertical pupils help an ambush predator better estimate the distance to its prey by sharpening depth perception and its focus on a target. That makes total sense as cats and alligators are faster and swifter than other animals.",http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/summer-reading-contest-winner-week-8-outrage-over-a-lions-death-is-the-definition-of-hypocrisy/,0.19558531746,0.430307539683

We have a political and economic system in which taxes and expenditures are fundamental.  Given that, saying that one won't raise taxes for anything, anyway, anytime is ridiculous: politicians, whether they like it or not, are playing in a system that collects taxes, lots of them.

Let's face it, one person's ""investment"" in early childhood education or job training will be seen by someone else as an ""expenditure""; one person's university will be, to someone else, a ""pork-barrel"" project.

First is that The Chicken Hawks that make up such a large percentage of the GOP are, on some deep level, aware that their belligerence is equaled only by their reluctance to serve.  It's why they went after Kerry in such a big way about his service; and why they don't respect McCain for his.   McCain is just a tortured reminder of past military failure.  And he doesn't even want to water board the 'Perfidious Muslims"". Second are those who did serve, and have always regarded the Senator as ""The Admiral's Boy"" an incompetent screw-up who caused the loss of several perfectly good aircraft (and probably the USS Forrestal fire). Third, are the ones who just don't care, because Mr. Trump so clearly enunciates their gut obsessions on the subject of ""Dark People Who Are Ruining Our Country"". (Though not how they put it, that is what they really mean). Their opinions are not moderated by reality, nor by reason.

2620,2620,"Krugman gets this entirely wrong. Firstly, he claims that growth in real  GDP per capita is only slightly faster in Texas than in the nation as a whole. However, if you look at the chart growth in Texas appears to be 1.6%/year versus 1.1%/year for the US. That is a big difference! Compounded over 18 years, the US grew by 22% while Texas grew by 33%. <br/><br/>The second issue is that most of the success of the Texan economy shows up as population growth rather than in per capita GDP. US states are different from national economies because they are very open to inflows of people and capital. If productivity grows workers don't see higher wages because of pressure from migrants. Some of the benefits are probably captured by capital, which responds by investing more and creating more jobs. I believe that most of the benefits are offset by the costs of moving people into the state.<br/><br/>Just for a minute, imagine Texas built a border fence to keep out migrants from other states. Now for every new job created, an old job has to be destroyed. That would happen through rising wages, and would result in much higher growth in real GDP per capita. As income shifted from capital to labor, consumer spending would rise and business investment would fall. The result would be a different kind of economic growth. The important point here is that there is a trade off between population growth and GDP per capita growth. More of one means less of the other. This is true because people can easily move in.",http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/state-growth-versus-national-growth/,0.176212121212,0.463484848485

Look at Texas' distribution of income.  Texas had a Gini Coefficient of 0.4771 in 2011, ranking it 8th in the U.S., which means that large Texas GDP isn't very equally or equitably spread about among Texans.<br/><br/>What's surprising and disappointing is that the same is true for California and New York but only more so, ranking respectively 5th at 0.4812 and 1st at 0.5033.

He attacked the University of California (Berkeley) back in 1965-66 to establish his bonafides with Republican conservatives to increase his chance of winning the 1966 gubernatorial election against Pat Brown -- which he did. As governor, Reagan used his position and presence on the university's Board of Regents to vilify and cripple Berkeley, a world-class institution, one he hated with a passion without making the slightest effort to study or understand it.<br/><br/>Gov. Walker should study that history -- but won't, because he's got his eye on a White House run; the same craven, cynical calculations Reagan made.

2837,2837,"After the debate on Thursday night, I have reevaluated my position on Donald Trump.<br/><br/>On the one hand, democracy in the US is totally dead.  It has been killed by the media which has censored unpopular views because they are not ""politically correct.""<br/><br/>This was illustrated by the attempts to shut Donald Trump down when he suggested in his announcement of candidacy that the US should stop illegal immigration.  Univision and NBC News tried to quash the expression of that view.<br/><br/>It is a message that needs to be discussed.  And simply calling people ""racist"" because they see that illegal immigration is a serious problem is wrong.  And it makes the discussion of viable solutions IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>So I hope that Trump continues his candidacy and continues to express himself on this issue.  Certainly Obama's executive action for providing amnesty was a disaster, and most likely unconstitutional.  Americans should not tolerate such a grab for power by the executive branch.  If you believe in democracy, you must also believe in a full discussion WITHIN CONGRESS.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Trump's ""solutions"" are not optimal.  Building a wall is not as important as mandating e-verify and stopping corporations which  have hired illegal immigrants because they want cheap labor.  The NY Times itself has had articles on this topic which implicate meat packers like Tyson Foods.<br/><br/>And Trump is wrong on other issues.

Fifth, politics and entertainment have been linked since Ancient Greeks, whose oratories competed in mesmerizing the audiences with their verbal antics.

I had hoped that an ironclad, verifiable deal could be reached to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>However, after reviewing the terms, I have concluded that this is a bad deal for one reason:  It is unverifiable.<br/><br/>The final deal permits Iran to stonewall the International Atomic Energy Agency’s request for access to suspect sites for up to 24 days. There are no anytime, anywhere inspections — the deal envisions a long process of consultation, arbitration, and implementation. Twenty-four days is more than enough time for Iran to conceal any illicit activity. Iran can further delay the process because it would have the right to challenge a UN request to visit a site and would sit on the arbitration board that settles disputes on inspections.<br/><br/>Granting Iran the ability to manage access will severely undermine the IAEA’s ability to verify an agreement. Former IAEA deputy director Olli Heinonen has warned that inspections must not be subject to a dispute resolution mechanism because it would hinder IAEA access. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, has similarly argued that given Iran’s history of deceiving the international community and “abusing the consultation process with the inspectors,” a deal must ensure anytime, anywhere inspections.<br/><br/>The deal falls far short of that.

The disasters visited upon American society and politics under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009 were no less significant than Buchanan's setting the table for the Civil War with his ineffective presidency in the late 1850s, Johnson's escalation of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and Nixon's criminal presidency in the 1970s. <br/><br/>It bears repeating once again that Donald Trump's campaign for president is no more ludicrous than Jeb Bush's campaign and arguably less so.

Also he's selling his union story - the union breaking that he did after he got elected in 2010, the unions that he busted that he never told anybody about while he was campaigning before he got elected.  The same story about the union protestors that he equals with ISIS. <br/><br/>Never mind he just tried to destroy the open records law in Wisconsin in the past couple weeks, but got caught, so this was dropped from ""The Budget""<br/>where they tried to squeeze it in.  Turns out some of the records he didn't want to go public were about IRIS, a program for the elderly and disabled that he wants to dismantle.  This program has been long term support so folks could stay in their homes instead of going to nursing homes.  Now first, why would a governor want to throw the elderly and disabled under the bus, and second, why would he try to hide his records that prove he's throwing them under the bus???<br/><br/>If a man can't be a little more creative than running for president on the same old union rhetoric or his Kohl's department store bargain basement clothes - what makes him think he can be president?

There evidence is overwhelming against a central bank raising rates in a liquidity trap, even a little bit, during a post-financial-crisis type of recovery in which debt overhang is a major factor in restraining demand.  <br/><br/>The Bank of Japan made this mistake way back in the 1990s and the result was persistent deflation and lost decades.  More recently the Swedish Riksbank also made the exact same error and so did the ECB in 2011.  In both cases, the central banks very soon had to reverse course and their economies ended up even more depressed with even lower below-target inflation rates than had existed beforehand.<br/><br/>What's more, recent research by Amir Sufi has shown that in the current situation in which debtors tend to be lower income people with low credit scores the ability of low rates to stimulate demand is severely limited.  This largely explains the very slow recoveries and low inflation in advanced countries following the 2008 financial crisis despite the fact that central banks are holding interest rates at or near zero.  But the same research shows that while lowering rates has little stimulative effect on demand raising them is much more depressing.

If 6 million people working 20 hours per week were working 40 hours per week they would add only 2% to total hours worked (in our labor force of 140 million).  Increasing our current growth rate, which is 2.9% by two percent would only increase it to 2.96%.<br/>Lest conservatives claim that also reversing the decline in our labor force participation rate would make up the difference, it would not even come close.  Our labor force participation rate has only declined 2% recently.  Another 2% increase in a growth rate of 2.96% increases it only to 3.02%.<br/><br/>Studies have shown that most of the people working part-time want to work more hours but employers are not creating the jobs.  Studies have also shown that most of the recent 2% decline in the labor force is due to retirement of the baby boom population.

The cost was almost double what the next highest insurance premiums were in WI from other insurance companies.  Almost double, and the state had no say!  <br/><br/>The people of WI knew this, but union members from around the country came in to protest, and the Dems went to Chicago to hide from a vote.  <br/><br/>Regardless of what party you favor, the size of the Federal government is out of control.

He is astoundingly corrupt, even by current standards. He is the only candidate with campaign finance investigations and staffers in jail (well, at least Mr. Christie's been taken to task)<br/>3. He crushes opposition. Not only did he not campaign on the labor issues, he threatened to call the National Guard if anyone protested, used excessive police force on singing protesters (charges ruled unconstitutional), and attacked our flagship university. He compared protesters to ISIS.<br/>4. He tries to scrap the rules. He tried to gut our open records law in an 11th hour budget amendment the night before the 4th of July, and used our job creation agency for unchecked giveaways to donors. No wonder he doesn’t want any records.<br/>Combine all this with his Reagan-messiah complex and the fact that, as this article states, he listens to no one, and you have one impervious individual. Oh, and he attends the same type of Pentecostal church that Ms. Palin was hounded for (the kind that believe certain people are a gift of spirit), but somehow he's getting a pass.

One definition is the deepest values by which some live their lives, the courage of ones' convictions;  as Mother Theresa said ""the good you do may be forgotten tomorrow, do it anyway, for in the end it was never between you and them…""  Few could live as he or she as it's not hip to care about those less fortunate unless you can feel superior, and that's not empathy, that's condescension.  Gandhi wrote ""Seven social sins: politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without morality, science without humanity, and worship without sacrifice."" All great spiritual leaders seem to have one thing in common: humility.  Humility with outspoken courage puts them at risk which is the price for humility.  Yet they inspire some to look deeper into the spiritual meaning of what it is to be on earth at this point in time. The Pope is not just talk.  He is a man of action, inspiring many  to question nearly all, yet be fully responsible for the answers.

3883,3883,"There was only one question about climate change.<br/><br/>The question was framed as follows:  Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state, George Shultz, has advocated for some kind of action on climate change, just as an “insurance policy.”  Why not follow Reagan’s example, and take out an insurance policy to respond to what scientists overwhelmingly believe will be devastating impacts of climate change?<br/><br/>Three candidates responded: Rubio, Christie and Walker. All 3 argued that nothing should be done by the federal government to combat the problem, and Christie even said that he “respectfully disagrees” with Schultz.   All 3 stated that government efforts to combat climate change won’t do anything to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Rubio said that the EPA’s regulations on carbon emissions from coal plants “will do absolutely nothing to change our climate.” Christie said he agreed, that regulations “will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea … [or] solve the drought here in California.” Walker was more measured, saying “the Obama administration has said will have marginal impact on climate change.”<br/><br/>The Republican/Tea Party has pushed this this argument lately, seemingly because it’s moderate — it falls between denying climate change is happening, and admitting that anything should be done about the problem. The idea is that regulations to limit carbon emissions won’t help solve climate change on their own, but they will cost coal jobs and raise Americans’ electricity bills.  <br/><br/>It's untrue.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/politics/candidates-use-second-gop-debate-to-taunt-trump.html,0.12,0.77

He’s a wonderful man and a great public servant, but he should not run for president this year, for the sake of his long-term reputation.”<br/><br/> A “wonderful man and a great public servant” is unlikely to win so he should sit out of the race to preserve his reputation? That's cynical, but suggesting that a man’s personal grief is a great rebranding or campaigning opportunity is just shameful.<br/><br/>In Stephen Colbert’s interview, Joe Biden wasn’t describing grief and loss as formative forces, he was explaining that his bedrock of family and faith help him through his grief when losses occur.  He didn’t single himself out as special, but instead repeated that he knew others have suffered tragedies with less support, so he felt fortunate.  He also gave a candid glimpse of why public service is important to him.<br/><br/>I encourage Mr. Brooks to watch the interview again. What Mr. Biden revealed that is truly refreshing for a career politician was humility.  And while that may not earn him the votes to win, it’s possible that the whole election process might -- as Mr. Colbert very astutely pointed out -- benefit from having someone in it who demonstrates service and sacrifice, someone who is “a wonderful man and a great public servant.” ",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/15/opinion/david-brooks-the-biden-formation-story.html,0.201098310292,0.509216589862

As you have noted many times Obama is not the strongest negotiator and with Iran he followed suit. there are real problems with this deal not the least of which is the lengthy period for inspection approval and the largest which is that even if the agreement works perfectly in 10 or 15 years the theocratic fascists who run Iran will have nuclear weapons. are you on board with this kind of nuclear proliferation? is it so ludicrous to question the quality of this agreement?,http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/r-e-s-p-e-c-t/,0.135238095238,0.570238095238
3955,3955,"So here's the real question.<br/>Not whether the GOP establishment can recover from a party divided by Trump, but whether the Democrats can survive a split caused by Bernie Sanders liberal progressives sitting out the 2016 election.<br/><br/>Trump is fine. He can bankroll a 3rd party run for the White House, because Trump is a billionaire and has a LOT of billionaire friends who he protects (says constantly he won't name them) that are onboard, or Trump wouldn't be doing this. <br/><br/>The independent voters who are flocking to Trump aren't swayed by the establishment attacking him, they've written both the Dems and Repubs off years ago.  <br/><br/>Here's the silver bullet Times readers:<br/><br/>The Tea Party.<br/><br/>I live and work in Washington DC. On Capitol Hill. I moved here for work after graduating from law school and got here a few weeks before Obama was sworn in. I've seen the Obama presidency from a ringside seat.<br/><br/>The Tea Party scared the you-know-what out of the Obama WH and the mainstream media, who after the HUGE Tea Party rally against Obamacare, mobilized the IRS, Obama WH, mainstream media and GOP establishment to destroy the Tea Party. <br/><br/>The Tea Party Republicans are FIRMLY in Trump's corner. And they vote. <br/><br/>A divided Democratic Party, with Bernie progressives sitting out, will cost the DEMS the White House in 2016. And guess who has the billions to be the one left standing in Nov 2016? Trump.<br/><br/>So keep it up libs. You're actually HELPING Trump win the White House.
