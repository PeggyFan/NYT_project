1,"Drug prices is just another reason to repeal and replace Obama Care. All proposed laws should be simple,short, transparent, readable, and online. Instead of health reform, politicians offer to build upon a unstable foundation. Sometimes construction can only be achieved by destruction. Obama Care was born from the house, senate, and president seeing an opportunity and devouring the whole thing. It will only be corrected when all three bodies are of the same mind. These proposals do not meet this test. ",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
2,"A one-liner indiscriminate and generalizing statement from Clinton erases 100's of billions of dollars in value in the healthcare stock market, on average now about six percent but up to ten percent reduction to anyone's healthcare stocks; and such just for political gain since Clinton knows full well congress will be Republican controlled for the foreseeable future. <br/><br/>A quote I pulled from Bloomberg: ""the Democratic presidential candidate said that if elected, she’d implement programs to force the industry to concede tens of billions of dollars a year in tax breaks, lower prices and increase research spending.""

6,"My husband's employer asks us to pay a deductible of $5,000 per person, so if two of the three of us would need serious care, we'd in effect have to hit the out-of-pocket cap of about $10,000 before the insurer pays for anything. This comes out of an after-premiums salary of about $37,000 a year. Until the last couple of years, drugs weren't part of the deductible, and you could obtain your prescription for a modest co-payment. Now drugs count toward the deductible, which means if you need a regular medicine to control a condition, you'd pay for it all until you hit $5,000 a year.<br/><br/>My daughter has to carry an EpiPen. The cost of a two-pack is around $400, though a fancier competitor is now available (easier to carry in a pocket, talks you through using it: very helpful for kids). You have to buy a new one every year even if you don't use it, because it expires. I have no idea where to get the money next month when that happens, while paying more than 8% of gross income in premiums (technically exempt from buying insurance).<br/><br/>Ours is a bronze plan, and the company offers a silver plan with a lower deductible. But the difference in premiums is so great that all you're really doing is paying the deductible in advance monthly. Since we're all healthy and no one has a chronic condition, it seems to make more economic sense not to pay the higher premiums every year, but only the higher deductible if need arises. It's extremely hard to weigh all the variables in choosing a plan.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
7,The problem with health care costs is insurance. The health care industry sees a bottomless pool of insurance money to exploit to their benefit. Since insurance companies get to keep a percentage of their costs they have no real compulsion to control costs; better to keep 10% of million as opposed to 10% hundred. <br/><br/>My brothers dentists actually told him that he needed to have more work done as he still had some insurance money left. <br/><br/>My allergist always schedules a two week follow up which I generally cancel. He is just skimming easy money and feels he can justify it. <br/><br/>Drug companies are no different. They will raise drug prices until the system totally breaks. Perhaps then we will get a nationalized health system and take the system out of the hands of people who base their worth on money. ,http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
8,"During the contentious drafting of the Affordable Care Act, a faction championed  by White House advisor Valerie Jarrett and Max Baucus got drug and medical appliance price controls taken off the table almost immediately in favor of an emphasis on coverage for the uninsured. Price controls enforced by economies of scale are the heart and soul of any modern health coverage scheme, and had the potential, if pursued, to bring truly ""affordable"" healthcare within reach of all americans. Sadly, the efforts of Peter Orszag, Zeke Emanuel, Rep. Henry Waxman and others along these lines, were ignored in favor of a Great Society style vision that I fear has set the cause of true health care reform in country back decades.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
9,"Although I favor it, we don't need national health insurance (or negotiating by Medicare) to control drug costs.  We already have a universal tool that could control costs - drug patents<br/><br/>The source of our drug cost problem lies in how drug manufacturers (a.k.a. Rx) have taken advantage patent protection.  Our government grants patent protection and should add a condition that protects Americans financially<br/><br/> Rx makes the vast majority of its profits on drugs that are patent protected.   Generic drugs are much less profitable - with the exception of usurious pricing of a few generic drugs with only one producer, so price can be manipulated.  <br/><br/>We grant drug patents and put many product safety conditions on manufacturers.  Adding one financial safety condition to patents could reduce our pricing problem significantly<br/><br/>That is, no drug company shall retain net profits greater than 11%.  That is about half their current profit level but still almost twice the median profit level of all businesses in the U.S. (i.e., 6.5%).  Other firms in the health industry that invest heavily in R&amp;D (medical appliance, instrument and diagnostic) all make about 11% profit.<br/><br/>Fixing profits will encourage Rx to also manufacture generics, like fixing average MPG encourages auto manufacturers to also make fuel efficient cars.  Rx may also reduce expenses for lobbying, direct to consumer advertising, providing ""free"" samples, etc. that allow them to keep the price of patent protected drugs too high",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
10,"The problem with prescription drug costs is that politicians have legislated  functional price supports for the industry that also serve as subsidies for drug consumers in other countries.   The remedy is simple.  Declare the United States as the global low cost market for prescription drugs.  Manufacturers would be able to sell medication anywhere in the world for any price they choose.  They just would not be able to sell them here for more than they do anywhere else.  The result would be greatly reduced expenditures by both Government Agencies as well as Health Insurers, including other large corporations that self-insure their employees.  The only losers would be executives and shareholders in the pharmaceutical industry and drug consumers in other countries.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately sensible reforms are always hostage to the lobby culture that reduces our elected officials to little more than prostitutes, and the Supreme Court by virtue of ""Citizens United"" to nothing but a common pimp.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html
11,"Why doesn't an ethical pharma (I know, I know, a contradiction in terms) just get the drug prescribed, even paying full price for say 5 pills.  Then do an analysis and come up with an alternative that can be made cheaper.<br/><br/>Or better yet, build a consortium of 5 or 10 universities that have PHD programs in pharmaceuticals/chemistry and ask wealthy alumni to fund a  research project to develop an alternative.

12,"Why was there no mention that Big Pharma and the healthcare industrial complex spent millions (if not billions) on lobbyists to prevent the federal government from negotiating on the prices of prescription drugs as part of the ACA? <br/><br/>""Affordable Care Act"" is a misnomer. It should have been called the Semi-Affordable Health INSURANCE Act. It has done little to make healthcare affordable but has been a windfall for the insurance companies. Most have gained thousands or millions of new customers and, as a result, higher profits. <br/><br/>The ACA is a game of wack-a-mole. Big Pharma and the insurance companies's #1 priority is not improving the health of Americans, it's finding loopholes in the law to maintain their profits. This procedure must be covered?

13,"Red herring of Pharma spending more on marketing than on R&amp;D is a really old one. The reason for this never-dying claim is that the cost of millions of free samples that doctors give to the patients to try out the drug, is marketing expense from the accounting standpoint. Hillary and Bernie should be ashamed of themselves when picking on the generally unpopular industry simply because it is politically beneficial - if they are after health care expense reduction, why not start with statistically useless spinal fusions at 70K a pop, hip replacements for Alzheimer patients or $3K ER charges for 4 stitches?

14,"I have long felt that the simplest solution is to require drug companies to accept a payment from Medicare equal to no more than 150% of the average paid in the other 20 OECD countries. This would incentivize drug companies to demand higher payments from European countries (to raise their average) and ensure that Americans weren't subsidizing the rest of the world (by too great a degree). I suspect if Medicare could buy it cheaper, the rest of the insurance plans would also benefit.  Up for debate is whether 150% is the correct amount, how the ""average payment would be calculated, etc. Poor countries could still be subsidized; the key thing is that the world's rich countries would be on equal footing.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html

The sicker the patient is and the more complicated care the patient requires, the more money the hospital makes. The more procedures the doctor performs, the more money she makes. But this latest episode of a former hedge fund manager trying to hold patients infected with toxoplasmosis hostage by raising prices of his drug 5,000% is beyond the pale. Time for Congress to step in and investigate and then pass price controls on the drug industry. Also, not allowing Medicare to bargain with drug companies for pricing of pharmaceuticals is a huge giveaway to the drug industry and a driver for increased health care costs.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/upshot/prescription-drug-costs-are-rising-as-a-campaign-issue.html

We all know the staggering monetary figures of raising children—hundreds of thousands, millions maybe, spent by the age 18.  A tax write-off here, a federal program there is pittance to the overall amount parents put into economies.  While I would never take such an un-humanist view of my own daughter as some cog in this massive economic engine, it makes sound fiscal sense for any nation to invest in its children, for not only do they represent vast strata of a consumer demographic, they will eventually grow up to be producers as well, unseating me and you and perpetuating this nation’s economy.  Evidence of the contrary?  Japan has had a dramatic drop in their birth rate for decades and this has a direct correspondence to their dip in GDP and an inability to counter slow growth.

While women have entered the work force in high percentages, the percentage of men performing domestic work has not increased at the same pace; leaving women with the double burden of wage work to maintain standard of living, and doing most of the unpaid work at home to maintain the needed family wellbeing.<br/><br/>This is no different in work culture of multinational corporations and small business alike which are dominated by western 'masculine' values.

Biden's authenticity and close connection with his emotional self were about as transparent as an American politician has allowed him or herself to be in recent memory.<br/>I have generally admired Biden's political inclinations and commitments over the course of his career. There have, to be sure, been some speed bumps, sometimes mere gaffes, other times more serious failings.But if some critics, like a former CIA and Defense Dept. chief, think that Biden has been consistently wrong on foreign policy, I would beg to differ. I think he has been mostly right, that he knows more about foreign policy than virtually any of the other candidates, and that his foreign policy inclinations suit me far better than his equally knowledgable competitors. On domestic policy, I think he understands the needs of working people as well as anyone.<br/>I personally ""feel the Bern""; Bernie Sanders suits me better than any candidate I can remember since the 1960s.

It would be good for the country if he did run and win.<br/><br/>My concern for him, if he were able to recover enough from his grief to be elected, is that he would have the same issue that President Obama has had: He has no Bobby.  President Kennedy's brother Robert  was completely committed to him, his values and goals. He was sounding board, advisor, ambassador to other officials and departments, and political watchdog.  He also spoke the truth to the president.  Robert Kennedy was John Kennedy's best friend.<br/><br/>In losing Beau Biden, our vice president lost not only his son, but also his best friend.  From everything I have  read, they were as close as the Kennedy brothers.  They too shared the same values and goals.  Beau understood the political world.   He would have been the person President Biden would have turned to during difficult times.  Beau would have been President Biden's Bobby.<br/><br/>The presidency is such a lonely job that anyone who holds the office needs a Bobby or a Beau.  Few have been so fortunate.  I am not saying that Joe Biden is a weak man.  He is a very strong man.  Still, I worry that the loneliness of the job, combined with his grief, would make the job even more difficult.  <br/><br/>I think this is the heart of the decision he faces.  I wish him well.

I think they are correct that this deserves some criticism. But I do not think how Biden handled the hearings is sufficient to be dispositive with regard to his character then or candidacy today. As chair of the Judiciary Committe, Biden had to make the hearings as fair as possible. The NY Times reported in 2008:<br/>//<br/>At one point, Senator Biden’s aides[,] and then he[,] told Ms. Abramson and Ms. Mayer that digging in too deep on Mr. Thomas’s intellectual legal prowess would’ve been a problem. One aide said, “it was a racial thing.” Mr. Biden himself said, “There was in fact a concern about whether or not to make the guy look stupid – what would happen if you embarrassed him.”<br/>//<br/>Biden voted against Thomas's nomination.<br/><br/>In 2008, then Senator Obama said: ""I would not have nominated Clarence Thomas. I don’t think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation."" Even Senator Obama, 17 years later, declined to pillory Justice Thomas regarding the sexual harassment charges.<br/><br/>I remember when Paula Jones charged President Clinton with sexual harassment. Instantly NOW attacked her. I remain a feminist. I am not a NOW supporter.<br/><br/>I believe Anita Hill and Paula Jones.

Choosing the word doubt is a misleading choice of word to describe Biden's mind. If someone asks me a question and I answer ""I doubt it""...it almost always means no. Or not able to. This is not the case with Biden. He is not expressing doubt, that implies an inability to do the job. He is, in my mind, expressing his desire to take a bit more time to come to terms with the enormity of the task. Two different things.<br/>My other thought is simpler.

Mrs. Clinton was his Secretary of State (Democratic Senator from NY and First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas).  How many times Hillary has won the brass ring in politics!  It is not surprising that Mrs. Clinton's numbers are starting to slide.  She started her campaign sprint far too early, four months ago - April 14 - a razzledazzle kick-off perfectly pixeled TV ad and her beautiful smile and cheerful ""I'm running for President!"".  Her private email server slip is not a big deal notwithstanding media scouring.  Bringing up the rear of the possible Democratic candidates for this 2016 election is Bernie Sanders - the Vermont Independent growing by leaps and bounds, and the odd possibility that Joe Biden will throw his hat in the ring soon. Joe Biden has had 43 years of exemplary public service, including his two terms as our Vice-President.  The three of them - Hillary, Bernie and Joe are golden oldies - ages 69 and 73 if elected.

Mr. Sanders is interested in governing.  How refreshing.  How unique.  We are so tired of equivocations and spin and stupid empty phrases like ""make America great again"" and ""the American people.""

In a theoretically perfect imaginary world, each party would get 50% of the total coverage, and the coverage would be divided by party.  So Clinton would get 25%, Sanders 25%, and each GOP candidate would get 1/17 of the GOP's 50%.  Can you see?  It's not fair to compare Sanders with Bush or Cruz because this isn't the national election, it's the primaries.  As Clinton's main challenger, he deserves much more coverage than 16 minor candidates in another party.

Looking at episodes such as Tilden and Hayes in the past, we see that the GOP, and voters in general, have liberalized since then, a process that benefits Donald Trump.  <br/><br/>For example, Reagan had a divorce in his past, which, at the time, was an issue for many conservative voters, all of whom had exemplary marriages, I assure you, but voters looked past Reagan's seamy past to elect him by a landslide.<br/><br/>Romney is a Mormon.  Some here might ask what the big deal is, but it most certainly was a big deal in the not-so-distant past.  Going back a ways, we see that Kennedy is a Catholic, something controversial among those voters who correctly were Protestants.<br/><br/>I take it that Jimmy Carter leans to the fundamentalist side of Christianity.

Clinton's favorability among African Americans remain considerably higher, but the dramatic shift in views on Sanders as people have gotten to know him suggests that he can build a much broader coalition than Bruni is willing to give him credit for.

The record is the U.S. stopped being a debtor from World War I; the U.S. middle class first became significant after World War II when the U.S. had no competition in manufacturing or industry. By the time of Reagan the WW II surplus was depleted &amp; under Republican policies the U.S. became the largest debtor nation in the world.

Similarly, Debe Tehrar (wife of a conservative Republican in the State legislature) was elected President of the Ohio State Board of Education with Kasich's support.  In 2013 when it was found that she had compared Pres. Obama to Hitler on her Facebook page, Kasich continued to support her.  Without complaint from Kasich, she also favored censorship of books she personally found offensive, e.g. Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye, stating that she didn't want her grandchildren reading it and she didn't ""want anyone else's children reading it.""  Kasich also appointed Cathye Florye to the State Board of Education in 2014 - she is on record as stating that children should be taught creationism in schools. Kasich's School Board appointee, Mark Smith, has a record of ranting against teachers who fail to teach biblical truth.<br/><br/>In sum, even though Kasich presents a relatively ""moderate"" stance within the Republican Party, I fear that, were he to ever be President, he would placate the hard right of his party to our nation's detriment.

Trump's poll ratings do show, unless the Democrats are blase, that his outrageous comments about fellow Republicans and HRC are not hurting him at all so far. In fact, he's gaining traction because many people, irrespective of their skin color and racial identity, find him refreshing, plain-spoken, direct, trustworthy and bluntly honest, one not married to PC notions of proprietary, not a mealy-mouth, professional politician who spouts poll-tested messages to pander to voters, not beholden to Wall Street and hedge fund tycoons, and uncompromising about what he believes is true. <br/><br/>By contrast, HRC is seen as beholden to Wall Street and widely reviled by many Democratic voters, in light of the private server scandal, as the epitome of blatant mendacity.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/politics/bernie-sanders-faces-skepticism-from-democratic-insiders.html

And I will be behind him 100%.  I moved to Virginia in June, and so far I don't like what I see.  People like to still fly their confederate flag.  People like to wear their gun on their belt.   Most of these people look like they have, at best, a third grade education.  Yet they are the most vocal about their rights to have guns.  Sure, you have that right - but shouldn't you also have a license and some education as well.  If you want to own a gun, just like with driving a car,  you should have to have a license, pass a written exam, carry insurance and prove to police/state agencies that you know how to properly use/store it.  And what would be so wrong with that???  It's no different if you  want to drive....you have to put some effort into the process.  As of right now, I can go to any gun show in Virginia - and buy whatever I want.  Gee, the fact that I have never fired a gun, and have no idea how to use a gun safely doesn't even enter into it.  That is just absurd to me.  I hope Mr. Parker gets a group together, and soon.

What the comments below demonstrate is that it is the arrogance he displays in the first three paragraphs, for example, that make people wonder if he's grownup enough to be a NY Times columnist for a game that has changed more dramatically than at any time in American history. Cohn doesn't wonder why a large segment of the population is drawn to Trump and Sanders as a lot of people didn't wonder why Jimmy Carter was beginning to do well in early '75 or why the senior Bush was losing badly to Clinton, when he had just won a war. Cohn seems to not see the intangibles in modern American politics, especially today's politics, and seems to give Sanders a chance in various areas only grudgingly. I agree with Mr. Netliner and LNW below. Maybe it's time for The Times to give a more experienced political reporter The Upshot just in case, you know, Bernie Sanders is actually for real, people begin to see him as less a Socialist and more a chance to take our country back.
