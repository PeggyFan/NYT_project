He has little time for anything but  what he considers \"serious issues.\" He isn't all that quick on his feet. The reporter's job was to show us the man...and she did.

Obviously, his campaign has work cut out -- but the press is heavy on marginalizing Sanders, only covering him as a slim chance, but meanwhile he is the only candidate to have articulated and released a serious platform. Look at the video of his Iowa press conference. He explains the folly of a press that only covers horse races and soap operas and never the issues.  Hear the crowd cheer." }

Others in this space have effectively rebutted that Bernie isn't attempting to compete virtually everywhere.  But I want to talk about the second part of this construction.

Why can't you do an informative article that clearly lays out why Sanders support keeps growing and the differences between Bernie and Hillary instead of one more \"Bernie will never make it article\"? I'm not even strongly for one or the other candidate but this inequality makes me lean strongly towards Sanders. He must be doing something right. " }

Whoever turns out to be the Democratic nominee - and I would not rule Bernie out - his or her task will be much harder because of that in both the presidential and congressional contests.  Thanks to the misguided current strategy, the Dems have abandoned any chance of winning in even moderately red states.  The Republicans don't abandon competing in any blue areas.

When an individual accumulates a certain amount of wealth their orientation shifts from seeking change to benefit themselves to seeking security to protect what they have accumulated. That point varies from person to person depending on their individual tolerance for uncertainty. Those who have wealth and have a low tolerance for uncertainty want to maintain the status quo. The only candidate running now who threatens the status quo, who proposes real change to benefit those who are working more and are falling behind, is Bernie Sanders." }

But sadly, it's clear someone like him has a snowball's chance in hell of winning the election today. His staff is right,  it would take a revolution. The best thing he could do is nudge Hilary and perhaps Congress to the left, by demonstrating to her that there is a ton of support for doing the right things for America." }

Sanders is a Senator from the small state of Vermont in the Northeast section of the United States.  Of course a large number of citizens aren't familiar or don't know him. The purpose of a campaign is to inform fellow citizens of their platform, ideas, ethics and whether a candidate has the qualities that would make a good President.

Let's see articles that compare Sanders' platform to Hillary's and other candidates in the Democratic and Republican Party.

Bernie Sanders isn't a household word yet, but he is the fresh and free voice in this woeful Presidential campaign of 17 months.  He is the real deal, not a stalking horse for any other candidate, and deserves wider media attention.  His grass roots movement selling good ideas for America and her people can't be denied and should be broadcast widely from coast to coast. Go, Bernie, go!" }

We're both active 79 year-olds, living on a fixed retirement income, and that's about all we can afford, but my husband and I are determined to rally our volunteers, to make phone calls, to knock on doors and do everything we can to put Bernie into the White House.

But the reality is we have a candidate - a candidate with passion, intelligence, and practical ideas. Our candidate truly speaks for us  and not just when polls tell him to. His name is Bernie Sanders and he will win based on the support and hard work of diverse throngs of people who have actually listened to him, compared him to the alternatives (if you want to call them that). We have found him eminently worthy of our time energy and enthusiasm.  #BernieSanders2016" } ], "commentID" : 15896069, "trusted" : 0, "userDisplayName" : "Catharsis", "createDate" : "1440570626", "userID" : 68107236, "replyCount" : 1, "commentTitle" : "<br/>", "status" : "approved", "sharing" : 0, "approveDate" : "1440585304", "userTitle" : "NULL", "recommendations" : 68, "permID" : "15896069", "picURL" : "http://pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6810/7236/cropped-68107236.jpg?0.3056921297533528", "editorsSelection" : false, "parentUserDisplayName" : null, "timespeople" : 1, "userURL" : "NULL", "userLocation" : "Paradise Lost", "depth" : 1, "commentType" : "comment", "updateDate" : "1440585304", "commentSequence" : 15896069, "reportAbuseFlag" : null, "commentBody" : "I like Bernie and I hope he never takes any money from the Super PACs.

I find Hillary Clinton's silence on this matter unconscionable.  Open debate is seminal to democracy. How can she call herself the leader of a party with that word in its name and not support \"early and often\" debates with Bernie Sanders? Well the answer is obvious it's because she's scared. And it really does make me feel sorry for  her. However, feeling sorry for someone and voting for them  as leader of the free world are two completely different things.

When asked if they would vote for a socialist, however, the 'yes' numbers were universally low; 2) Given that I think the unwillingness to compromise is a part of the problem in Washington in recent decades, I will not vote for someone who holds the same basic approach as the GOP right-wing, i.e., my way or the highway. That is not democracy, it is dictatorship. We need someone who has their beliefs, but recognizes that they are just that, not ultimate truths. <br/><br/>Now, if only I was less worried about Hillary's baggage. " }
