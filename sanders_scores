For example, I'd honestly be interested in hearing what you find interesting in Paul and Rubio as far as regenerating the Repub party. <br/><br/>What I'd REALLY love to hear from you, though, is how you can live with the frankly nutty stuff and its current dominance in your party—people who don't believe in evolution, who regularly denigrate science, who have a poor education or ignorance of the world (like the TP congressional candidate who, when asked what our stance should be towards Saudi Arabia, said that ""we should have free trade with them""), who believe that 47% of the nation is on some kind of welfare, who don't acknowledge the failures of our healthcare system but claim the ACA has ""death panels"", and so on. <br/><br/>These are not minor threads: It's a rare Repub candidate who'll depart from the party line in these things—say, who argues against the ACA for substantive reasons while backing anything at all to help ordinary people get care. And shutting the government down to try to un-pass a duly-passed law is pretty extreme and loony as well. <br/><br/>We know you're intelligent and thoughtful, Ross. So how do you see these things? How can you live with a party that promotes them? The lack of Repubs speaking out against birthers doesn't shame you? The prospect of Ted Cruz or Michelle Bachmann as a candidate does not alarm you?

166,166,"One problem with this analysis is that it doesn't acknowledge the role that delegate selection rules have on determining who is a viable candidate.  In earning the nomination, it's all about gaining the most delegates to the national party convention.  Elites play an outsize role in part because a large chunk of delegates are super delegates, not selected by any primary or caucus process.  These are party national committee members and elected officials.  Delegate allocation rules deny any delegates to any candidate who fails to achieve at least 15 percent of the vote, preventing slightly more marginal candidates in a crowded field from gaining traction.  On the Republican side, most States have winner-take-all delegate allocation rules, so a candidate who receives less than 40 percent of the vote in a competitive 3-candidate primary could nonetheless win all the delegates from that State.  A long, drawn-out nominating process such as the 2008 Obama-Clinton contest would be virtually impossible to see happen in the Republican nominating process.  The Democratic Party is somewhat more democratic in allocating delegates proportionally, once a candidate exceeds the 15 percent minimum.

Their passion should also be balanced by gratitude.”  Finally, conservatism is marked by enjoyment - finding delight in the achievements and blessings we have - magnanimity, winsomeness, and grace.<br/><br/>How does this differ from the liberal mindset?  It doesn’t.  The only thing that differs is the lens through which one reads these attributes:  individualism vs collectivism.  The last 2 attributes are the luxury of the privileged ‘haves’.  Those who look upon the world with the smug attitude “got mine.”  This attitude (a matter of the heart, really) is antithetical to Christianity, to which so many conservative Republicans claim they adhere.  Love of self focuses inward.  The Bible exhorts people to focus outward, and serve God and others in love.<br/><br/>Years ago conservatism meant traditional values and caution in the face of change.  Now, conservatism means selfish individualism, and that does not make for a sustainable social compact.<br/><br/>Wehner needs to leave the bubble of his Center’s ivory tower; hit the streets, factories, and neighborhoods; and connect with people in the real world.

The question when human life begins is not separate from the question of what it is for something to be a human being.

For example, does human life evolve in stages (kinetics, sensitivity, viability, etc.), or should we distinguish personhood from mere human life?  So if abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, it does not follow that all pre-natal terminations of human life are terminations of a pregnancy.  That is something to argue.

""Black Lives Matter"" signs are not on any of the lawns in the neighborhoods where those murders have occurred. <br/><br/>I wish Mr. Blow would address the bigger issue of black lives taken every day by other blacks due to violence from gangs and drugs.  I'm really tired of Mr. Blow continually pointing his quill in every direction except at his own proverbial back yard.

731,731,"According to the FBI states for 2013, black-on-black crime accounted for 2,245 murders.  White-on-black crime accounted for 189 murders.  In other words, for every on black person killed by a white person in 2013, 12 were killed by black people.  And that is without normalizing for the fact that blacks comprise only 13% of the population and whites a much greater percentage.  <br/><br/>I would be very interested to hear Mr. Blow or BLM draw a causal connection between the above statistics and the ""institutional racism"" that he and they cite as the root of all failures in the inner-city African-American communities of America.  <br/><br/>Now you may shut down people with cries of ""RACIST!!!"" whenever anyone suggests that much of the pain in black communities is self inflicted, but you will have a tough time doing the same to statistics.  <br/><br/>Sadly, by their refusal to acknowledge that the black community bears a large part of the responsibility for it's own problems, and to accuse anyone who suggests so of racism, moderate and fair minded people who are not of a blindly liberal perspective are finding it more and more difficult to swallow the tired excuses and victimization mantra of people like Mr. Blow and BLM.

With such a good hand from the previous dealer, it's obvious how badly Bush played the cards.) Bill Clinton had no prior-generation family members in Washington.

The person doesn’t need health insurance. He needs health care.""

The Republican argument for eliminating government involvement in business transactions is based on the belief that government is inherently inefficient. I cannot argue with that - certainly, private organizations are more efficient than the government, and the market will take care of those that aren't. But private organizations also come with a strong profit motive, and all the moral hazards that go with it. Thus, we need to trade off between an inefficient but trustworthy organization (government) and the very efficient but inherently untrustworthy private enterprise, to manage the various activities that drive our society.<br/><br/>It's worth pondering over why we don't leave the defense of our country in private hands, and why some crucial resources such as water are handled by the government.

This serves hospitals just fine because despite the lip service paid to primary care, the goal is simply to increase referrals to hospitals for expensive money-making procedures: higher lower- paid ARNPs and PAs, who not only are paid less, but also more likely to make more of those expensive referrals due to their less rigorous training.

I was in Ravello a month ago, and hearing he'd left, I worried whether he was still with us. Whether he made that remark or not, his life, as far as I can discern, suggests something I've always suspected. Expats, and others  who seem to hate their countries, care more about them than others.  <br/><br/>America's in awful shape. Italy was beautiful.  Yet I was glad to get back.  To me,  America's always interesting, always changing. Perhaps we'll have another revolution, and end up like Costa Rica: pleasant, with no army. Unlikely  with the second amendment.  Perhaps we'll become a dictatorship run by  militarized right wing billionaire evangelicals. Or we can do as many other  countries do, muddle through. Let another country take over our  job of building military bases in other countries to keep hate of their  country humming  high, and to ensure the requisite  number of  enemies. We'd love a foreign base - Chinese or Colombian - in, say, Maryland. Oregon?

He also was rude, vulgar, and wrote and opined apparently with the intent to provoke, rather than reflect any reality.  Further he was a misanthrope, an arrogant narcissist, and to top it off, he apparently was proud of all of the foregoing.<br/><br/>It always astonishes me that those in the literary and other arts, who have to have high intelligence to succeed, seem most vulnerable to the charm, wit and talent of people like Vidal.

1807,1807,"I generally agree with most of the comments posted here. Ream and Gonzales were the only real defensive prospects on display last night and we should (and I think will) see more of Agudelo and Bunbury.<br /><br />However, a note on the midfield: I'm not sure why it's generally assumed that the U.S. is ""stacked"" in the midfield and the players on display last night have little chance to break into the starting XI. The best international teams in the world generally choose their starting XI based on some combination of current form and whatever strategy is to be employed against the upcoming opponent. The fact we're not more dynamic in this sense is a major failure of the USMNT. Despite whatever successes Spector, Jones, Edu, Holden, et. al. may experience at club level, we all know they have virtually no chance to displace Donovan, Dempsey (depending on where he's being deployed) or Bradley in the starting XI, regardless of form or opponent.<br /><br />Bradley, especially, often seems to be the weak link here as he's not physical enough to operate as a deep-lying box-to-box mid he's deployed as. It would seem both Jones and Edu would be better suited to this role when healthy. However, the elder Bradley doesn't seem to be inclined to bring his son from the bench so long as he's in charge.<br /><br />Furthermore, the U.S. has lacked quality wing play since Beasley's decline in form a number of years ago. Donovan can capably man either flank, and I think this should be his primary position on the USMNT. Opposite him, we've often asked Dempsey to fill a winger's role, which he seems to be ill suited to fill.<br /><br />My point is, while the U.S. does have more talent in the midfield than perhaps any other position, it has yet to find a grouping there that has formed a cohesive unit. In fact, I can't remember the last time the U.S. controlled play from the midfield against a top international side.<br /><br />Perhaps we should stop pretending we have a midfield even Barcelona would envy, and start trying out some different combinations there. There is no one in the U.S. player pool with enough talent that they should be an automatic selection in the starting XI, save Tim Howard.",http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/for-u-s-mixx-and-dax-to-the-max/,0.0721544715447,0.390205187766
1808,1808,"Well put, John Godfrey. The brilliance of some Dax McCarty moments, like his laudable long-distance strike on frame and some very effective positive passing, was overshadowed by several of the dreaded sloppy negative passes and shockingly poor first touches.<br /><br />I thought Sean Franklin put in a hopeful performance. Is he right back that we need to bring some width to the attack, while having the pace and fitness to track back? Maybe.<br /><br />Omar Gonzales' quiet competence went largely unoticed, until he was replaced by a bumbling Marvell Wynne. When Wynne got burned for the go-ahead Chile goal, you just had to wonder whether OG would have committed the same howler. If I have any general concerns about Omar, it's the lack of truly incisive passes out of the back that can put our attack on the front foot and my sense that he should be an enormous threat on every corner kick.<br /><br />As for Agudelo and Bunbury, their composure was world-class.  Agudelo won the penalty in impressive fashion, worthy of any good EPL striker. And, Bunbury buried the penalty like a seasoned international.  Let's see if these guys can hold on to their confidence and composure as the pressure continues to ramp up.",http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/for-u-s-mixx-and-dax-to-the-max/,0.141616161616,0.442924139353
1809,1809,"Entertaining game. We definitely have promising young talent coming up, and we definitely still need to find a left back. Not really into player ratings, but do have some observations.<br /><br />The Good: got to love the hustle and energy out there. Defenders were quick to close and we didn't panic when challenges arrived. Pressed high and pushed forward when the opportunities came. Spacing was generally pretty good, without the midfield clot we see too often. For a side that hadn't played together I was impressed. I was particularly impressed by the work rate of McCarty and Diskerud. And I think we have good things coming in Bunbury and Agudelo -- the offense definitely picked up when they came in.<br /><br />On the other side, Chile did well attacking down the wings to stretch the field. That was a great turn and strike by Paredes for the goal. They were also quick in transitioning back on defense and ultimately only gave up a pretty soft penalty.<br /><br />The Bad: A little concerned that the forwards still struggle to get good looks at goal and create real scoring opportunities. That said, Bunbury and Agudelo were only on for 30 minutes and (AFAIK) hadn't played together before, and the late strike they put together was promising.<br /><br />I thought Chile was lazy in some of their passes. Mostly poor shot selection as well: too many screamers from 40 yards out that end up in the stands.<br /><br />The Ugly: our back line. The fullbacks were hopeless on defense, especially at left back, and it was way too easy to get behind the back four. Loyd in particular got skinned time and again, eventually giving up the assist, Franklin wasn't much better, and Wynne's marking and positioning were quite poor..<br /><br />Also: Chile's finishing was just terrible, the Paredes goal excepted. When they did get behind our line, the ball would be tangled up underfoot or they'd hesitate a bit and let the defense close.<br /><br />Finally, I take back what I said in another thread about maybe trying out Jonathan Spector in midfield. We should definitely try Spector in midfield. He's now started 4 games in the middle in the EPL, FA Cup, and League Cup and scored in 3 of them. It's just great that a guy who'd been buried so far down the depth chart he hardly ever made the 18 can revitalize himself and deliver big in a new position. Props to Avram Grant for putting him there.

One more thing do not go after T.O. you had other choices out there and you didnt go after any of them. He is just a cancer ready to bring down the team. I sure hope the SKINS do much better next year. I am tired of loosing seasons and not making it far into the playoffs.

1888,1888,"One of the strange aspects of the QB position revolves around the phenomenon that the postion is so important, and is generally recognized to be so important, that the reputation and aura of the QB can play as a factor in the fortunes of the team.  The perceptions of the QBs teamates, his coaches, the owner, the opposition can all start to act on the team in strange ways.<br /><br />I would suggest that clarity and leadership confidence in the QB position seems to deliver a competitive advangtage to mnay teams and that the opposite is conversly a disadantage.   Once a team has reached a consensus that it has “the guy” many aspects of the team’s overall strategy are clarified and can be refined.<br /><br />Then there is the dreaded “controversy, the “is you is, or is you ain’t my QB” question that torques the fortunes of teams in so many bizarre ways.<br /><br />Which brings me to Mr. Tebow.    Denver already has two big “is you or ain’t you” guys in Orton and Quinn.    Tebow may be a great player in many ways but  he doesn’t really do much to clarify the future for Denver.   I’m not sure about the finances but I think it’s possible that Tebow will be getting the biggest paycheck of the three.<br /><br />It’s entirely possible that one of these guys will emerge as the undisputed future of the Bronco’s offense within the next two years.  But it seems more likely that Denver will be bogged down in all these question marks:  Orton’s ability and durability, Quinn’s underachiever rap, Tebow’s learning curve.<br /><br />",http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/live-updates-first-round-of-the-n-f-l-draft/,0.147685185185,0.457407407407

1895,1895," I at least give the Skins credit for attempting to address a serious need in the draft.  The ownership and GM seriously undervalued the o-line in recent years to the detriment of their offense.  Time will tell if Trent Williams was the right choice, but the team at least prioritized the greatest need.<br /><br />As far as the Tebow pick, the first round selection seems like a real stretch.  I have to imagine there was a pretty good chance that he might have fallen to the 3rd or 4th round.  He's got some of the intangibles, a great work ethic, and he'll have a great teacher.  Still, it's hard to believe that they picked him where they did.  If this was God's will, then it suggests at a minimum that God may have a very wicked sense of humor with respect to the Broncos organization.  Of course, time will tell with this pick too.

But we  did have, not so very long ago (with gold and, later, silver certificates).  I won't go into the arcane reasons why such is no longer possible, except to say that, even if we wanted to, we no longer own the gold or silver to 'back' all the money in the current supply.  We now, essentially, have a fiat currency, backed by nothing but debt and ""good faith,"" if such is even an appropriate term in this context.  But I am not suggesting a return to the Middle Ages, but rather, eliminating the debt machine we call the Federal Reserve and returning money creation powers to the U.S. Congress, as originally stipulated in the U.S. Constitution.<br /><br />If I may continue your metaphor:  In the Middle Ages, there was never enough money for everyone to enjoy prosperity -- just like now, in every economy that relies on a debt-based monetary system constricted or inflated by the fractional reserve deposit expansion system.<br /><br />My reference to currency policy during the American Civil War was not to Confederate currency, which quickly lost value after the conflict, but to ""Greenback"" dollars, which the Union printed to help finance the war.<br /><br />Google on!

Favre publicly undermined his coach.  Manning did not.  Sure you can argue that Favre has every right to call plays and undermine his coach all he wants because of his awesome career, but many NFL players probably feel differently from that.

1954,1954,"Ah, some (transparent) bait.... Luis, you say you were being objective, but the way you used the word ""diva"" is clearly a reference to Favre. And how can you be objective when you call him a diva? Not only is that word way overused when writing about Favre (as any number of football-watcher blogs illustrates), but it's an unfair descriptive. A real diva wouldn't play professional football in 300-straight games over 18 years, in my humble opinion. And I also don't agree with the comment that Favre cares only about himself. The man loves to play football, and he's still pretty darn good at it. Speculation that he's a ""mercenary just out to protect his own interest"" is bar-room or ""blogosphere"" poppycock.<br /><br />Really, there's no need to get into a Favre/Manning debate. They're both spectacular, durable, competitive winners. Comparing their situations last week is like comparing ice hockey to figure skating. Manning wouldn't have been ""protected"" in a game that mattered, at least in the coach's mind (more on that in a second). On the other hand, if Favre had meekly surrendered when Childress thought out loud about sitting him down for his own good, he'd have been roundly criticized, as Rich has pointed out.<br /><br />I respect Favre's fire. The easy way out of that Panthers game would have been to duck further Julius Peppers hits by sitting down. Favre wanted to play, and he badly wanted a win. Besides, if Childress really, really planned to protect him by benching him, wouldn't he have had Tarvaris Jackson warming up?<br /><br />On the Manning issue, I'd agree with Rich again. Of course he should have spoken up and said, ""Coach, let's win this one."" Caldwell's ""resting my regulars"" plan was a week too early. Now his team plays in Buffalo, and assuming the regulars will get even more rest while the Bills go all out for a win --- at home, with at least a full half chasing around an inexperienced QB --- there's a chance the Colts will lose a second straight game. If they do, consider the mindset Caldwell has created: Suddenly they're on a losing streak, and they're taking two straight losses into a bye week. I'd be afraid of the ""rust"" factor --- and as Neil Young said, rust never sleeps.<br /><br />When the Colts finally get back to a serious game after three weeks of rest, will they be able to pick up where they left off when they were 14-0 --- or will they have trouble getting back on the horse? Will they run into a buzz saw --- a team that might be building momentum (kind of like the Giants in 2007)? Might they even face the Jets --- who would be fearless and have nothing to lose? Beating the Jets would have eliminated a lot of these questions. Caldwell should have made it happen.<br /><br />Of course, beating the Bills will solve a lot of problems too --- but Buffalo's first-stringers vs. the Colts' B team makes it game.

Fortunately for Manning, he got the first down, but had his pass been dropped he may have gotten himself benched. Who in this world knows how to run a west coast offense better than Brett Favre? Childress? You've got to be kidding! Has he ever even played the game, let alone read a defense at the line of scrimmage? QB's in the past like Johnny U and Bart Starr called their own plays for very good reasons, yet, somewhere along the way these egotistic coaches took that away from them, relegating them to handoff/throwers. IMO, every QB should call his own plays, as it was from the beginnings of the game. It was always great to hear the announcer say ""Alright, what's Unitus gonna call now"" as they were breaking the huddle. An essential element of the game has been lost on the likes of ""run it up the middle until it's third and long Childress"" who have no qualifications and no business at all calling plays.

1963,1963,"Luis, I understand your point a bit clearer now, but I think anytime you start talking about a player being worried about his image then whether intentionally or not I think you start raising questions about his priorities.  As I mentioned elsewhere on the blog, I haven't been the greatest Peyton Manning fan, early on I thought there was entirely too much hype and fawning around him.  I begrudgingly came to accept that he's among the headies signal callers the game has ever seen.  All of the histrionic arm flapping that drove me crazy early on, I came to realize was legitimate and necessary changing of the play at the line, mixed in with a strong dose of gamesmanship to psyche out the defense.<br /><br />What was never in doubt for me was his respect for the game and for those who've paid their dues so that he could be where he is now... I think we're both on the same page there, and agree with you that to the extent that he doesn't want people to ever think that he's above the game, then he worries about his ""image"" in that regard.<br /><br />Favre on the other hand... it pains me to see what a circus his career has devolved into.  Not that anyone should care, but I once had nothing but the utmost respect for him and what he brought to the game, the unbridled joy, the everyman's attitude, the caution to the wind approach in an age when uptightness was the rule.  In the past two years however I'm starting to see him as being more of a mercenary, just out to protect his own interest even to the detriment of team unity.  To be fair, I don't think he deliberately tries to upset the apple cart where it comes to chemistry and team dynamics... just that his singular focus on winning sometimes gets in the way of him seeing the bigger picture, that sometimes in order for the team to achieve what's best for the TEAM, Brett Favre needs to take a backseat at times and let someone with a more balanced and objective... dare I say it, dispassionate approach guide the reins.

Keeping in mind that these were children admitted to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic, not a pediatric psychiatry clinic, The Lancet's editors might well have wondered how 12 children with developmental problems would show up there in a row. Describing a clinical sample as a consecutive series means that although the cases appear one after the other and share a problem appropriate for admission to the given clinic, they presumably have no other connection. If you assume that the odds of a child having a developmental disorder are an unrealistic 50/50, then the chance of getting 12 consecutive such cases in a gastroenterology clinic is the same as tossing a coin and getting 12 heads in a row, which is 0.000244. Using a realistic prevalence estimate for autism of 5.3 cases per 10,000 for children under age 16 in North Thames, reported by B.

His life story is anything he wants it to be, for any reason, without any explanation, subject to no facts at all, and if he is ever called out on any of this he accuses the questioner of playing a ""gotcha"" game on him. Trump crystallizes the warped Evangelical requirement for pathological subjectivity at all costs, with himself as his own final authority. Sadly for those believers who still humble themselves before the example of Christ and the Word, Donald Trump is exactly what millions of shallow self-anointed Evangelicals value.

All 3 argued that nothing should be done by the federal government to combat the problem, and Christie even said that he “respectfully disagrees” with Schultz.   All 3 stated that government efforts to combat climate change won’t do anything to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Rubio said that the EPA’s regulations on carbon emissions from coal plants “will do absolutely nothing to change our climate.” Christie said he agreed, that regulations “will not do a thing to lower the rise of the sea … [or] solve the drought here in California.” Walker was more measured, saying “the Obama administration has said will have marginal impact on climate change.”<br/><br/>The Republican/Tea Party has pushed this this argument lately, seemingly because it’s moderate — it falls between denying climate change is happening, and admitting that anything should be done about the problem. The idea is that regulations to limit carbon emissions won’t help solve climate change on their own, but they will cost coal jobs and raise Americans’ electricity bills.  <br/><br/>It's untrue.",http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/politics/candidates-use-second-gop-debate-to-taunt-trump.html,0.12,0.77

However, he tends to allow that emotion get in the way of practical long-term solutions.<br/>In 1981. when Clinton was saying with emotion - “No one can say I’m soft on crime.” Joe Biden, then the junior senator from Delaware, quickly became the point man for showing that Democrats would not go soft on criminals. “One of my objectives, quite frankly,” he said, “is to lock Willie Horton up in jail.” Biden cast Democrats as the true party without mercy. “Let me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,” he said in 1994. “The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties … The liberal wing of the Democratic Party has 70 enhanced penalties … The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells.” I for one am so tired of the liberal wing  - they have destroyed the safety net with their welfare reform. Their ""3 strikes you're out""  has created too many gray wastes as Ta Nisi Coates has pointed out so eloquently in The Atlantic's ""The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration"".

2302,2302,"When Mr. Brooks wrote last month that Joe Biden shouldn’t run for president, what he actually said was that in the current climate of voter anxiety, “A career establishment figure like Joe Biden doesn’t stand a chance. He’s a wonderful man and a great public servant, but he should not run for president this year, for the sake of his long-term reputation.”<br/><br/> A “wonderful man and a great public servant” is unlikely to win so he should sit out of the race to preserve his reputation? That's cynical, but suggesting that a man’s personal grief is a great rebranding or campaigning opportunity is just shameful.<br/><br/>In Stephen Colbert’s interview, Joe Biden wasn’t describing grief and loss as formative forces, he was explaining that his bedrock of family and faith help him through his grief when losses occur.  He didn’t single himself out as special, but instead repeated that he knew others have suffered tragedies with less support, so he felt fortunate.  He also gave a candid glimpse of why public service is important to him.<br/><br/>I encourage Mr. Brooks to watch the interview again. What Mr. Biden revealed that is truly refreshing for a career politician was humility.

He stopped the teacher union from collective bargaining, and that was not crippling public employee unions.  <br/><br/>The teachers union in WI had been extorting the state for years.  They set up their own health insurance company and dictated that the state could ONLY purchase (and MUST purchase) insurance from the union.  The cost was almost double what the next highest insurance premiums were in WI from other insurance companies.  Almost double, and the state had no say!  <br/><br/>The people of WI knew this, but union members from around the country came in to protest, and the Dems went to Chicago to hide from a vote.  <br/><br/>Regardless of what party you favor, the size of the Federal government is out of control.

Conservatives have seen a lot of candidates with nice resumes, who seem sufficiently conservative on paper, but who don't seem to really believe in conservatism.  Mitt Romney's 49% gaff was devastating for one key reason that people on the left don't understand: it revealed that he didn't view conservatism as a model that worked for everyone.  Ted Cruz and most conservative voters believe that less government and more free enterprise gives all classes of Americans the best shot at realizing the American Dream.  They hate corporate welfare more than welfare welfare.  And they think that conservative policies are better even for the poor than government paternalism.  In other words, conservatives can be compassionate without creating a new government program to prove it.<br/><br/>Cruz doesn't have to be radically right on all issues.

Why would the black electorate vote Republican after the voter suppression that went down in 2012?  Next question.  If the black electorate is 'enslaved' on the Democratic 'plantation', what is going to happen the next election cycle (2014)?  The way the districts are drawn (as of 2010) favors Republicans, not Democrats.  So the black electorate would have to come out in the same numbers as they did in 2008 and 2012 to surge Democrats to take back the House now wouldn't they?  Don't get me wrong, I wish they would.

2765,2765,"So, why do blacks vote disproportionately for Democrat candidates? That's the key question.<br/><br/>To me, a white male, I believe it's because blacks are generally far more supportive of the comfort spawned by government-infused equality rather than the discomfort and risk that come with personal responsibility. The reasons for this are many: historical aspects related to feeling or being treated subserviently, a self-centered view about entitlements, and a lack of education. <br/><br/>One need only look at the black community as a whole to see a group of Americans who have not been able to extract themselves from their lot. They are less educated, more likely to have babies out of wedlock, far more likely to have abortions, more likely to come from broken families, more likely to commit crimes including black on black, and more likely to be on the government dole. And all of this is AFTER the liberal policies intended to eliminate poverty, increase education and bring everyone up to a certain standard. Trillions of dollars spent and we're at the same point we were in the 1960s. WHY???<br/><br/>Black republicans are merely speaking truth to lies and false narratives of white Democrats, something that most blacks do not want to face because its own shortcomings come into clearer focus. <br/><br/>Unlike white Democrats, I have faith in blacks' abilities in all facets of life.

2793,2793,"I have ample respect for Dr. Carson's accomplishments. I also know that getting to positions of power within academic medicine is as much an exercise in political maneuvering as it is being a good doctor. He's more than welcome to express his beliefs from whatever podium he is given. <br/><br/>He likes to tell his mean streets to medicine story, and it is compelling. There are others with similar stories that often go unheard. (I went to medical school with some of them.) Movements love a front person with a compelling story; so much so that the stories sometimes become grossly exaggerated or distracting. Often they are stories of  individual perseverance, devoid of context, and missing key players that performed vital roles along the way.  No one achieves what Dr. Carson did without a lot of help: friends, family, mentors, scholarships, financial aid, role models, etc. Where are these players in his story? In the wings no doubt, while he's on center stage.<br/><br/>Look at the story of Dr. Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, a Harvard-trained neurosurgeon who came here as a teenager to pick crops in California's Central Valley. A relative told him early on that he'll live and die in these fields. A chance misfortune made him realise that there was a better way, and he pursued it. He tells his story with humble reverence for all those who helped him. And most importantly, he doesn't believe that his story qualifies him to act as an expert in all matters of public policy.

In the 2008 elections and again in 2012, most Democrats voted for Obama PURELY because he was this great black hope. Anyone else who didn't believe was swayed by the image of a smooth-talking snake oil salesman who hides his past behind a carefully crafted smokescreen. Voted for the racist white Republican? Oh, then we must be a bigot because we believe differently! Time and time again, I heard the tired refrain ""you are racist if you don't vote for Obama and believe in his hope and change.""

If the party would somehow offer him the kind of national leadership position he seemed destined for ten years ago, perhaps the GOP would find the person it seems to be looking for.<br/><br/>That said, I am not confident they can do so--the GOP has become increasingly extreme in many of its views, so much so that it stands more in opposition for opposition's sake rather than offering an alternative.

But like all voters, Latinos will evaluate policy and ideas and whether they feel welcomed into the Republican fold.  They won't just look at the candidate's surname to determine whether or not he's got their backs.

Much was made about how he seemed to criticize Obamacare in front of Obama himself!  *gasp*  But I saw very little analysis of what HE thought would be a good way to finance health care.  He proposed to give every baby a Health Savings account and deposit a few thousand dollars in it.  <br/><br/>I actually think this sounds like a great idea!  Why not set aside money for every individual up front that could be invested conservatively and wisely, allowed to grow, and use it to defray future health care costs?  What is wrong with that?

Republican women and Republican minority members seem to be universally rebuked by those who otherwise fight for the rights of women and minorities. That, to me, suggests that organizations promoting advancement and equality for minorities really mean only members of minorities who agree with the political philosophy of the organization. Rather than celebrate the achievements of others as an example of the goals which can be attained, they routinely tear down the person as if he or she was not even qualified to be minority member just because of political affiliation.<br/><br/>That is very sad indeed, because those organizations, which rightfully defend victims of systematic discrimination, thereby create a subclass of themselves, against which they then discriminate.

Dr. Carson is a devout Saturday-Day Adventist, a persuasive speaker and writer, and no doubt, a highly accomplished pediatric neurosurgeon.  On his personal successes, he overestimates the individual attributes of personal responsibility and hard work, but underestimates the contributions of fate (good fortune) and social circumstances.  Politically and sociologically, he appears to be naive and too simplistic.  Benjamin Carson and Republican Politics?  I think it would be a mismatch -- either he would be a disappointment to the GOP or the GOP would be a disappointment to him.

 I have a lot of experience in the field. A certain percentage of alcoholics can report a familial trend. Others report no one in their families drank but peer pressure got them started in high school and by age 30-40 were full blown alcoholics. Earlier AA meetings held mostly middle-aged or older members. Now, younger and younger persons-even age 18- are clinically diagnosed as alcoholics. Some persons become alcoholics late in life after the death of a spouse after being lifelong abstainers.  ""Evidence of causality""is difficult to ascertain. Scientific studies do not prove but suggest a causality. Many persons attend AA and are never interviewed or studied. Most published literature draws material from treatment centers. Others never recover and die from the disease.<br/>
In my experience persons who want proof have alcohol issues of their own. Alcoholism is the disease in which the sufferer is held back from recovery by denial.<br/>

They are part of our country's tradition of initiating youth into adulthood through rites teaching domination, oppression and even torture (the resemblance between common frat initiation rituals and U.S. ""enhanced interrogation"" practices is striking).  <br/><br/>I'm a graduate of Dartmouth College, recently under the spotlight for a Rolling Stone article published about horrible hazing practices at--yep--Dartmouth's chapter of SAE. I believe the title of this article: ""When a Hazing Goes Very Wrong""--is misleading. Teaching initiates to disregard their own judgment in favor of ""following orders,"" and teaching our youth that others' well-being is not their responsibility--is very much the point of fraternity hazing. Occasional deaths--to say nothing of the astonishing number of rapes committed in frat houses--are considered ""collateral damage,"" as made evident by college administrations' uncaring responses to these incidents. <br/><br/>Initiation rites are ancient; they exist across cultures, reflecting each culture's values and ethics. The problem lies much deeper than with alcohol's availability to young people. It's past time for our country to examine our initiation rites, to understand not only the consequences they have on our youth--but what these rites reflect about our entire culture.
